8,0071853.jpeg,,"History is turned on its comic head when, in 10th century England, King Arthur travels the countryside to find knights who will join him at the Round Table in Camelot. Gathering up the men is a tale in itself but after a bit of a party at Camelot, many decide to leave only to be stopped by God who sends them on a quest: to find the Holy Grail. After a series of individual adventures, the knights are reunited but must face a wizard named Tim, killer rabbits and lessons in the use of holy hand grenades. Their quest comes to an end however when the police intervene - just what you would expect in a Monty Python movie. The movie starts out with Arthur, King of the Britons, looking for knights to sit with him at Camelot. He finds many knights including Sir Galahad the pure, Sir Lancelot the brave, the quiet Sir Bedevere, and Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir Lancelot. They do not travel on horses, but pretend they do and have their servants bang coconuts to make the sound of horse's hooves. Through satire of certain events in history (witch trials, the black plague) they find Camelot, but after literally a quick song and dance they decide that they do not want to go there. While walking away, God (who seems to be grumpy) come to them from a cloud and tells them to find the Holy Grail. They agree and begin their search. While they search for the Grail, scenes of the knight's tales appear and why they have the name they have. Throughout their search they meet interesting people and knights along the way. Most of the characters die; some through a killer rabbit (which they defeat with the holy hand grenade), others from not answering a question right from the bridge of Death, or die some other ridiculous way. In the end, King Arthur and Sir Bedevere are left and find the Castle Arrrghhh where the Holy Grail is. They are met by some French soldiers who taunted them earlier in the film, so they were not able to get into the castle. King Arthur and his knights embark on a low-budget search for the Grail, encountering many, very silly obstacles."

Aaron Altman, a talented but plain correspondent, carries an unrequited torch for Jane. Sparks fly between the three as the network prepares for big changes, and both the news and Jane must decide between style and substance. At the Washington DC bureau of a national network news division, Jane Craig is a news producer who knows that she is always right. Beneath her veneer of self-assuredness, Jane is a bundle of neuroses also knowing that she has troubles convincing people that she is right, those neuroses manifesting themselves in crying to release emotions when she thinks other people are not looking. Aaron Altman is a news reporter, brilliant in his understanding of the stories he covers, but who is generally under-appreciated as the geek. Jane and Aaron are best friends and regularly work together on news pieces. While Jane respects Aaron professionally, Aaron in turn is secretly in love with Jane. Both Aaron but most specifically Jane abhor the trends of news being more entertainment than news, and the focus of style over substance. Into the bureau enters Tom Grunick, who is hired as the new news anchor. Tom has had a meteoric rise in the business starting in sports, getting a job as a sports anchor before moving onto a news desk as anchor. Tom realizes that he has no business being in ""news"", with the issues of general news, and especially political news in Washington, not coming naturally to him. He also realizes that his strengths are as a salesman, specifically of himself, largely because of his good looks and his good communication skills, and by association anything of which he speaks. Tom admires Jane in every respect and wants her to be his mentor in learning the ropes of his job. He, however, epitomizes everything she abhors in news, she believing it his own job to better himself as a news person. Regardless, Jane is attracted to Tom and somewhat hopes that his admiration of her is also a romantic one. If they do allow themselves to enter into a personal relationship, they will have to find if they can overcome Jane's issues of what Tom represents professionally in the business she loves, and if they can relate to each other beyond their work. Also adding some complexity to their situation is Aaron, who sees Tom as competition both professionally and personally for what little personal time Jane has. Take two rival TV reporters: one handsome, one talented, both male. Add one producer, female. Mix well and watch the sparks fly."

Daingerfield Phelps III (who is always drawing caricatures), are captured and interred at a POW camp in Northern Germany near the end of WWI. Their relationship has always been an antagonistic one based on what Phelps sees as O'Gaffney pushing him around. O'Gaffney's rank is despite being wanted by the police back home as a con man. It is because of these differences that their resulting friendship at camp is so unlikely, the friendship based on both having the nerve to attempt to escape. On a snow covered day, they do manage to escape, in part by stealing white robes to camouflage themselves against the snow. In their adventures and misadventures on the outside in trying to get to safety, those adventures which include being mistaken for Arab prisoners, they find themselves as stowaways on board a cargo ship headed to Arabia. It is there that they meet a beautiful Arab woman named Mirza, who they save from drowning. They are both immediately smitten by her, which is why they are so disappointed to learn that she is betrothed in an arranged marriage to the ruthless Shevket Ben Ali. As the two try to reach the safety of an American consulate, they also decide to try and liberate Mirza, which may be more dangerous than fighting in the trenches in the battlefields of France. An American soldier, W. Dangerfield Phelps and his detested sergeant, company top kick Peter McGaffney, are captured by the Germans while engaged in a bitter fist fight inside a shell-hole on the Western front. The two bond in the German POW camp and escape into the snow outside the perimeter, dressed in white burnooses they have purloined from Arab POWs, which render them virtually invisible in the snow. Recaptured, and mistaken for Arabs by their garb, they are sent to Turkey aboard a German prisoner train, from which they escape. Accidentally finding themselves on a Russian freighter, Phelps and McGaffney save an Arabian princess, the daughter of the Emir of Jaffa, from drowning. The amorous ship's captain, who has been competing with the two Americans for the woman's affection, demands fare from the damsel in distress. Phelps -- penniless after he and McGaffney earlier had bribed the captain to stay out of the ship's brig -- offers to pay for her as he has fallen in love with her. (Phelps takes the liberty of kissing her, for which she has removed her veil, an act witnessed by one of her retainers.) The captain responds that they must pay him tomorrow, or he will put them in irons. McGaffney gets the money by mugging the ship's purser and locking him up in a berth, and the grateful princess tells the two that her father will repay them. McGaffney, much to Phelps' objection, insists she write out an I.O.U. Shortly thereafter, the princess is taken from the ship by an Arabian official, the Shevket, as it anchors off her homeland, and before departing tells the disappointed Phelps that she is to marry Shevket per her father's orders. After she leaves, the two Yanks abandon ship ahead of the now-freed purser and the angered crew. The two soldiers swim to shore, and the hungry McGaffney demands that they go see the princess' father to get their money back in order to get something to eat. Phelps convinces McGaffney to accompany him to the U.S. Consulate for aid, but they are thwarted when they spy the ship's captain and purser talking to the consul. It is time for Plan B. -- go to the Emir and ask for their money back. Little do they know that Phelps' transgression with the princess has been reported, shaming the Emir and Shevket, whom both have sent men to track down the unwitting pair and kill them. Two American soldiers are captured by the Germans on the Western Front during World War One and escape a POW camp only to stumble into further life-threatening adventures when they come across an Arabian king's daughter while on the lam."

He decides a more judicious approach may be to work behind the scenes rather than be front and center in the fight as he has been. On June 7, 1776, Adams gets Virginia Congressman Richard Henry Lee to propose a motion in Congress to debate the issue, which finally passes. However when the vote for independence finally looks like it will pass, its chief opponent, Pennsylvania Congressman John Dickinson, manages to pass a motion that any vote for independence needs to be unanimous. As a delay tactic, Adams initiates a successful motion to postpone the vote for three weeks to July 2, 1776 until they can vote on the actual text for a declaration of independence - his assertion is how can they vote on something that does not exist. Adams and Franklin talk a reluctant Virginia Congressman Thomas Jefferson to be the one to draft the document. Jefferson's reluctance is that he has other more personal issues on his mind. As Jefferson takes to his writing duties, Adams and Franklin and their supporters know they only have three weeks to convince the six opposing colonies to support independence. As Franklin states, it may take some improvisation and some compromise. A musical retelling of the American Revolution's political struggle in the Continental Congress to declare independence."

Chronicles his campaigns in Gaul and Egypt, his rivalry with General Pompey, and his eventual assassination at the hands of Brutus and Cassius. The story of the rise and fall of the Roman Emperor Gaius Julius Caesar, born July 13, 100 B.C., and starting his career as a young Roman with visions of greatness for the Eternal City. When Sulla conquers Rome with his troops, Caesar is one of the very few to stand up against the despotic dictator.

223,0029604.jpeg,,"Terry Randall, rich society beauty, has decided to see if she can break into the Broadway theatre scene without her family connections. She goes to live in a theatrical boarding house and finds her life caught up with those of the other inmates and the ever-present disappointment that theatrical hopefuls must live with. Her smart-mouth roommate, Jean, is approached by a powerful producer for more than just a role. And Terry's father has decided to give her career the shove by backing a production for her to star in, in which she's sure to flop. But his machinations hurt more than just Terry. The Footlights Club is a women's theatrical rooming house in New York City. It is the residence for many a struggling actress, most who can barely make ends meet, hence the reason that they decide to live in the inexpensive club with cramped quarters, shared bathroom and the bad lamb stew for dinners. Elderly Catherine Luther lives there solely to be able to relive her past minor glories on the stage with her younger, inexperienced house-mates. Judy Canfield tolerates dating who she considers a boor name Milbanks and setting one of the other girls on double blind dates with them solely to get out from meals of bad lamb stew. Talented Kay Hamilton has had one success on Broadway in an Anthony Powell produced play a year ago, but cannot even get into see Powell now. Running out of money and late on rent, forgoing eating in an effort to bargain on the ""board"" part of the rent, she believes she was born to play the lead in Powell's next play, ""Enchanted April"", which she also believes will get her back on her feet if she can only get in to see Powell to get the part. Womanizing Powell is currently dating another of the Footlights' girls, Linda Shaw, who lords her expensive gifts of jewels and furs over the others, but who remains in the shadows on her dates with him because of his married with child status. Into the club comes Terry Randall, who to the others obviously has money, which her roommate, forthright cynical dancer Jean Maitland, believes is from a sugar daddy. Terry's air of superiority and intellectualism also does not sit well with Jean, especially as Terry believes one does not need to study but just be smart to act well. In reality, Terry is an heiress - a fact she does not tell the others - her ""wheat king"" father Henry Sims who does not want her to pursue acting as a career. Unknown to Terry, her father goes about trying to prove that Terry does not have what it takes to become an actress, his action which unwittingly leads to tragedy and for the first time in her life true emotion from Terry. A boardinghouse full of aspiring actresses and their ambitions, dreams and disappointments."

She doesn't even have enough money for the basics of food and shelter. Gay cabaret singer Carole 'Toddy' Todd may befall the same fate as Victoria as he was just fired from his singing gig at a second rate club named Chez Lui. To solve both their problems, Toddy comes up with what he considers an inspired idea: with Toddy as her manager, Victoria, pretending to be a man, get a job singing as a female impersonator. If they pull this scheme off, Toddy vows Victoria, as her male alter ego, will be the toast of Paris and as such be extremely wealthy. That alter ego they decide is Polish Count Victor Grazinski, Toddy's ex-lover who was disowned by his family when they found out he was gay. The Count auditions for the city's leading agent, Andre Cassell, who, impressed, gets him a gig performing in the city's best nightclub. In the audience on the successful opening night is Chicago nightclub owner and ""businessman"" King Marchand, a stereotypical macho male who falls in the love with the woman he sees on stage, which doesn't sit well with his current girlfriend, Norma Cassady. King is shocked to learn that that woman is a man named Count Grazinski. While King tries to reconcile his romantic feelings for ""Victoria"" (in truth, King doesn't truly believe the Count is a man), his business associates won't tolerate his change in sexual orientation. Although feeling emancipated being treated as a man, Victoria, as herself, in turn falls in love with King. To pursue something with him as a woman would mean giving up this lucrative career. But the career may also come to an end in a jail term if the authorities find out that Victoria and Toddy have committed fraud in this impersonation. Set in 1930s Paris, starving opera singer Victoria (Julie Andrews) is aided by gay cabaret performer Toddy (Robert Preston). When Victoria dons Toddy's ex's clothes and then sends the abusive ex flying with a booming shout and an equally booming right hook, Toddy is hit with inspiration: he'll pass her off as a female impersonator.

It all goes well until Chicago ""businessman"" King Marchand (James Garner), starts to investigate, sure that a man like himself could never fall for another man!

The only people at the reading of her will are her twin adult children, Jeanne and Simon Marwan, and the executor, Nawal's long time employer and friend, notary Jean Lebel. The will contains many unusual requests, the most unusual being two sealed envelopes, one to be delivered by each of the twins to their father and to their brother respectively. The unusual nature of these requests are that their father as they know passed away years earlier during the war in the Middle East (where Nawal was raised) and they have no knowledge of any other offspring.

Set on a long English summer in the early '80s, SON OF RAMBOW is a comedy about friendship, faith and the tough business of growing up. We see the story through the eyes of Will, the eldest son of a fatherless Plymouth Brethren family. The Brethren regard themselves as God's 'chosen ones' and their strict moral code means that Will has never been allowed to mix with the other 'worldlies,' listen to music or watch TV, until he finds himself caught up in the extraordinary world of Lee Carter, the school terror and maker of bizarre home movies. Carter exposes Will to a pirate copy of Rambo: First Blood and from that moment Will's mind is blown wide open and he's easily convinced to be the stuntman in Lee Carters' diabolical home movie. Will's imaginative little brain is not only given chance to flourish in the world of film making, but is also very handy when it comes to dreaming up elaborate schemes to keep his partnership with Lee Carter a secret from the Brethren community. Will and Carter's complete disregard for consequences and innocent ambition means that the process of making their film is a glorious roller-coaster that eventually leads to true friendship.

Hydroplaning was like a religion in town, Madison being the only community worldwide that owned its own competitive hydroplane, the Miss Madison, whereas all other boats were corporate owned or sponsored. Madison also was one of only six stops on the hydroplane racing circuit. Jim once piloted the Miss Madison, but a racing accident in 1961 that injured him and killed his best friend, a fellow pilot, ended his racing career. He had since worked behind the scenes for the team, but was getting more and more involved - as his teammates left town - to the point of being head of the team in 1971. This focus on racing exasperated Mike's mother, Bonnie McCormick, who wanted Jim to focus more on their family, which meant leaving Madison for a more stable and thus better life. The American Power Boat Association (APBA) chose by lottery Madison to host the Gold Cup Championship race that year, the most prestigious race on the circuit. This choice was not a done deal as the town had to put up a $50,000 deposit, money which it did not have. In addition, Jim was determined to get the Miss Madison in shape for the Gold Cup, despite her twelve year old age, the battering she took in season races, and the team having neither the time, money or technological expertise to make the necessary repairs to get her near the quality of other newer boats. And other issues made Jim have to make the decision if he would once again get behind the wheel competitively. Despite loving his father and hydroplaning, Mike had an inferiority complex compared to the other children who traveled the race circuit as Madison was seen as an unsophisticated backwater that did not deserve to host the Gold Cup, as the Miss Madison was seen as a relic, and as the other kids taunted Mike about Jim being afraid to race. That summer would show Mike and the world just what Jim and Madison were made out of. In 1971, air-conditioner repairman and boat enthusiast Jim McCormick entertains his desire to 'go down' as a legend in the record books when the Gold Cup hydroplane boat race improbably comes to his small town of Madison, Indiana. Immediately, Jim seizes his opportunity to enter the contest. With a motley crew of fellow mechanics and friends at his side, Jim fixes up his old boat and brings hope to the blighted industrial city. A story about a man's personal struggle to victory in the 1971 Madison, Indiana hydro-plane regatta."

Angel Eyes (who had been looking for Bill Carson) discovers that Tuco and Blondie met with Carson and knows they know the location of the gold. All he needs is for the two to lead him to it. Now The Good, The Bad and The Ugly must all battle it out to get their hands on $200,000 worth of gold. During the American Civil War, three men set off to find $200,000 in buried gold coins.

The Ugly is Tuco, a Mexican bandit who's always only looking out for himself. Against the backdrop of the Civil War, they search for a fortune in gold buried in a graveyard.

His life takes a bizarre turn when a prostitute neighbour complains about the loss of her pimp. His partner, upon hearing the situation, suggests that they fill that opening themselves using the morgue at night as their brothel. Against his better judgement, he gets talked into the idea, only to find that it's more than his boss that has objections to this bit of entrepreneurship. Chuck Lumley is a nice, unassuming man. His fear of life is the primary reason he took a job as a morgue attendant rather than stay in his previous high stress job on Wall Street, despite having a natural aptitude in finance and business. He is dismayed to learn that he has been reassigned to the night shift at the morgue, if only because it will take away time available to spend with his straight-laced but neurotic fiancée, Charlotte Koogle. He is even more dismayed when he meets his new night shift colleague, William Blazejowski - who calls himself Billy Blaze - a manic, non-stop talking man, who is always trying to come up with get rich quick schemes, which are mostly hair-brained ideas. After Chuck befriends his neighbor, a good-natured hooker named Belinda Keaton, he learns that Belinda's former pimp was murdered, leaving her and many of her hooker friends pimp-less and thus unprotected by the unpredictability of their johns. From this knowledge, Billy sprouts the latest germ of a scheme: that he and Chuck, in their unsupervised state, should act as pimps - or what Billy calls love brokers - for Belinda and her friends during their night shift at the morgue. Chuck eventually agrees, if only because of his affection for Belinda, but he expands on that idea into a full-fledged pseudo-legitimate business for all their collective benefit. The questions become if this business is sustainable in light of the fact of everything about it being against Chuck's general nature, and if he will be able to balance his growing feelings for Belinda against having a personal relationship with a hooker."

461,1522863.jpeg,,"Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, many believe, Pablo Escobar's Medellín Cartel and the Cali Cartels were largely responsible for financing and building the Colombian National soccer team into one of the world's best. But in an early match against the United States in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, a Colombian defense man named Andres Escobar-no relation to Pablo-committed an own goal that led to the team's elimination. Less than ten days later, Escobar was gunned down outside a bar in a suburb of Medellin. He was shot 12 times, and the murderer shouted ""goal"" each time the trigger was pulled. Was Escobar's murder an isolated incident, or were gambling organizations controlled by the cartels responsible? Award-winning director Jeff Zimbalist will examine the mysterious events leading up to and surrounding Andres Escobar's death. Pablo Escobar was the richest, most powerful drug kingpin in the world, ruling the Medellín Cartel with an iron fist. Andres Escobar was the biggest soccer star in Colombia. The two were not related, but their fates were inextricably-and fatally-intertwined. Pablo's drug money had turned Andres' national team into South American champions, favored to win the 1994 World Cup in Los Angeles. It was there, in a game against the U.S., that Andres committed one of the most shocking mistakes in soccer history, scoring an ""own goal"" that eliminated his team from the competition and ultimately cost him his life. The Two Escobars is a riveting examination of the intersection of sports, crime, and politics. For Colombians, soccer was far more than a game: their entire national identity rode on the success or failure of their team. Jeff and Michael Zimbalist's fast and furious documentary plays out on an ever-expanding canvas, painting a fascinating portrait of Pablo, Andres, and a country in the grips of a violent, escalating civil war. The rise of Colombian soccer is attributed to the influx of drug money into the sport by Pablo Escobar and the other drug cartels. However, the team's swift decline after Escobar's death results in the murder of star player Andres Escobar."
462,0048452.jpeg,,"How do we understand faith and prayer, and what of miracles? August 1925 on a Danish farm. Widowed Patriarch Borgen, who's rather prominent in his community, has three sons: Mikkel, a good-hearted agnostic whose wife Inger is pregnant, Johannes, who believes he is Jesus, and Anders, young, slight, in love with the tailor's daughter. The fundamentalist sect of the girl's father is anathema to Borgen's traditional Lutheranism; he opposes the marriage until the tailor forbids it, then Borgen's pride demands that it happen. Unexpectedly, Inger, who is the family's sweetness and light, has problems with her pregnancy. The rational doctor arrives, and a long night brings sharp focus to at least four views of faith. It's August, 1925 in rural Jutland, Denmark. Three generations of Borgens live on the family farm. Morten Borgen, the long widowed family patriarch, is a devout Lutheran. Most closely aligned to him religiously within the household is his only daughter-in-law, Inger Borgen, married to Morten's oldest of three adult sons, Mikkel Borgen, an agnostic, which Morten sees as a failure in his own parenting. Inger is currently pregnant with what will be her and Mikkel's third child, the first two being daughters, Maren and Lilleinger. Johannes Borgen, Morten's middle son, was his hope of that devout Lutheran among his children, as Johannes was the one who decided to study theology. But what happened with Johannes is that his intense study turned inward, resulting in him going mad, he believing that he is the current Jesus Christ. And Morten believes his youngest son, Anders Borgen, although a good man, is emotionally weak. In town, the Petersens, Peter Petersen the tailor and his wife Kirstin Petersen, belong to a fundamentalist sect of the church. Anders and the Petersens' daughter Anne Petersen have fallen in love and want to get married. Despite both being good, capable people, they know they will have problems convincing their parents of the union because of the differences in their religions. Indeed, Morten sees people like the Petersens as being holier than thou, while the Petersens see Morten as being not up to their faith. What happens with Inger and her pregnancy may give them all a different perspective of faith. People believe in the dead Christ, but not in the living."

She finds herself pregnant, which throws her plans awry. She bakes phenomenal pies at Joe's diner, listens to old Joe's wisdom, tolerates her sour boss Cal, is friends with Dawn and Becky (her fellow waitresses), and finds a mutual attraction with the new doctor in town. As the pregnancy advances, life with Earl seems less tolerable, a way out less clear, and the affair with the doctor complicated by his marriage. What options does a waitress have? Jenna is a small-town waitress at Joe's Diner, who has a great knack at making delicious pies there. However, Jenna is in an unhappy marriage to her controlling and immature husband, Earl, who always takes the money she works hard for, but Jenna keeps some of it hidden from him. Jenna suddenly finds her life has taken an unexpected turn when she discovers she's pregnant with Earl's baby. But the unhappy pregnancy changes Jenna's life as she becomes determined to win the $25,000 pie contest prize money and begins an affair with her handsome, married gynecologist that gives her confidence and an attempt at happiness. In the American south, Jenna Hunterson is a waitress at Joe's Pie Diner in Redhook. Along with Becky and Dawn, the other waitresses, Jenna makes the pies for the diner, she who is known in her circles as the best. She funnels her energies into her creative pie making, this love and skill which was passed down to her by her now deceased mother. Her newer pie creations are always a reflection of what is happening in her life at the time. Otherwise, her life is a fairly unhappy one because of the people in her life. Cal, the diner's manager, is always barking orders, never providing compliments.

Even though Becky and Dawn are her close friends and confidantes, their lives are as screwed up as Jenna's and thus they can't provide her much constructive guidance. However, even Becky and Dawn would rather be themselves than Jenna, largely because of Jenna's husband, Earl, who she fears and hates because of his controlling behavior. That control includes keeping all the household money, even her diner wages and tips, and treating her like his sole property. She doesn't have the means to leave him, she secretly hiding money from him to enter the United States of Pie bake off with a $25,000 first prize, the contest which he would not allow her to enter if he knew what she was doing. That control is why she is dismayed to learn that she is pregnant with his baby, from one of their infrequent sexual encounters when he got her drunk. Although she plans to keep the baby, she plans not to tell him until absolutely necessary, and treat the pregnancy as a cold-hearted fact with respect but not love, as she realizes this baby will tie her more to him. As Jenna goes through her pregnancy, she has to deal with a new physician, Dr. Jim Pomatter, a nervous but otherwise sweet man. Although Dr. Pomatter is also married, he and Jenna embark on an affair, and although they seem to be falling in love, she doesn't want him to save her. If Jenna can delve under the surface of these relationships, she may get a clearer picture of what her post-delivery life as a mother may be like. Jenna is a pregnant, unhappily married waitress in the deep south. She meets a newcomer to her town and falls into an unlikely relationship as a last attempt at happiness."

In Kilronan, Mrs. Kearney, the innkeeper's mother and a bit of a gypsy woman who has lived in the area for the better part of her life, tells Kieran and Jack about life in the town in 1939 when a high-spirited Fiona Flynn, Kieran's mother, started seeing a peat farmer named Kieran O'Day. Kieran O'Day grew up a ""poorhouse bastard"", and as such he was always shy and considered an outsider amongst the townsfolk. Because of his standing in the community and the differences in their ages (she being only seventeen, he in his thirties), Fiona and Kieran's relationship was looked down upon by those considered the upstanding in town, including Fiona's widowed mother, Mary Flynn, and those associated with the church. Mrs. Kearney slowly tells the entire story of Kieran and Fiona's relationship, the tragedy that prevented their love for not being enough to endure the scrutiny, the stories of the ""curses"" that befell the Flynn family, and the truth behind the person Kieran Johnson knew as his father. A middle-aged teacher discovers photos from his mother's past that convinces him that she has not told the truth about his real father. Venturing into Ireland where he believes his real father to be, a past romance slowly unfolds."

If they complete their next mission successfully, they will be the first Army Air Corps B-17 Crew to complete their tour of duty. Visiting communications officer Lt. Col. Bruce Derringer wants to publicize and highly tout their accomplishment, even before it happens, as a long term good news campaign at a time when there is little good news to report.

The previous success of the Memphis Belle is despite the disparate natures of the ten men, whose personalities and backgrounds could not be more different. Each of the ten has a differing view of Derringer's publicity campaign as well as to the probable success or failure of what will be their last mission regardless, a dangerous one into enemy territory over the skies of Bremen, Germany. The ""Memphis Belle"" is a World War II bomber, piloted by a young crew on dangerous bombing raids into Europe. The crew only have to make one more bombing raid before they have finished their duty and can go home. In the briefing before their last flight, the crew discover that the target for the day is Bremen, a heavily-defended town that invariably causes many Allied casualties. It's May 17, 1943; the day before the Memphis Belle's, a B-17 bomber, 25th and final mission. After their final mission, they crew of ten men get to go home.

But the mission hadn't been flown yet. With the target being Bremen (not Dresden), which was a target heavy in surface-to-air artillery, the flak wouldn't be easy to get through. With weather, nerves, and dreams all playing a part in the finishing of the mission, the crew has to become the lead plane in the squadron and get the job done of bombing a Nazi supply factory, if they get it wrong, many innocent people could be killed. The story of the American bomber crew of the ""Memphis Belle"", the first US airmen to complete a full tour of 25 missions during the air battle of Europe during the Second World War. The film begins the night before the Belle's last mission, and follows the crew through the hectic flight that they must endure, and survive, in order to go home. In 1943, the crew of a B-17 based in UK prepares for its 25th and last bombing mission over Germany before returning home to the USA."

Still single seven years after the breakup of his marriage, John has all but given up on romance. But at the urging of his ex-wife and best friend Jamie, John grudgingly agrees to join her and her fiancé Tim at a party. To his and everyone else's surprise, he actually manages to meet someone: the gorgeous and spirited Molly. Their chemistry is immediate. The relationship takes off quickly but Molly is oddly reluctant to take the relationship beyond John's house. Perplexed, he follows her home and discovers the other man in Molly's life: her son, Cyrus. A 21-year-old new age musician, Cyrus is his mom's best friend and shares an unconventional relationship with her. Cyrus will go to any lengths to protect Molly and is definitely not ready to share her with anyone, especially John. Before long, the two are locked in a battle of wits for the woman they both love-and it appears only one man can be left standing when it's over. John is a sad-sack of a man, that state which he wears openly on his sleeve. This phase of his life led to the dissolution of his marriage to Jamie seven years ago, she who left him. That depressed perspective takes another hit when Jamie, who he still treats as his primary confidante, tells him that she is getting remarried to a man named Tim. To get John out of his funk for at least one night, Jamie and Tim invite him along with them to a party where they encourage him to socialize with the plethora of fun women who they promise will be there. Against the odds, John, openly lamenting about his depressed state and the reason why, does make a connection with beautiful Molly. What Molly likes about John is how open and honest he is about himself and what he wants, which leads to John not following the regular social conventions of dating in his pursuit of her. Molly, while seeming to like John, is in full non-disclosure about something about her own what she states complicated life that is making her keep her distance to a degree. John does find out that that complication is Molly's unusual relationship with her twenty-two year old son, Cyrus, who still lives with her and upon who she dotes. Molly's treatment of Cyrus is because of his sensitivity about life in general. However, John finds that Cyrus, truly an adult in many respects, openly welcomes him into their house and into their lives. John eventually finds that what Cyrus portrays on the surface and what he is truly feeling and thus manipulating are two different things, Cyrus whose every action is in an effort to get John out of their lives while making it look like it's all John's fault. As John is truly falling in love with Molly and she for him, John has to decide if Molly is worth the battle with Cyrus, and if so how best to handle the situation in what could easily be Molly needing to take a side, which more than likely would be on her son's. John and Molly, a divorced middle aged man and a single mother meet at a friends party and start up a small relationship, all John has to do now is meet Molly's son... Cyrus"

567,0030055.jpeg,,"This haunting, unforgettable film, based upon Maxim Gorky's 1913 autobiography, shows a twelve-year-old's journey in life against the tumultuous backdrop of 19th century Russia. With tableaux beautifully vivid and forceful, it recounts the touching relationships which develop when Gorky is put into custody at his grandparents' home.

Gorky's poverty-stricken childhood formed his life-long compassion for the underdog, and the film is filled with powerful portraits of lower class people whose qualities of integrity and dignity shine through their hopeless circumstances. Among many others are the half-blind Grigory, who works at the grandfather's dye factory, and Gorky's little orphaned friends, who live out of garbage cans, dreaming of a utopian neverland. From these portraits come an inspiring, panoramic view of human conditions and conflicts. A drama reveals the great writer's inauspicious early years as an orphan raised by conniving relatives."

As the wheels fly off, and their competing ideologies clash, what emerges is an emotionally engaging (and entirely plausible) farce. In a storm of razor-sharp verbal jousting and large-scale set pieces, Four Lions is a comic tour de force; it shows that-while terrorism is about ideology-it can also be about idiots. In a British city, four men have a secret plan. Omar is disillusioned about the treatment of Muslims around the world and is determined to become a soldier. This is the most exciting idea Waj has ever heard. Better still it's a no brainer because Omar does his thinking for him. Opposed to Omar and everyone else on earth is the white Islamic convert Barry. He'd realize he joined the cell to channel his nihilism - If he had half the self knowledge of a duck. Faisal is the odd man out. He can make a bomb - but he can't blow himself up just now coz his sick dad has ""started eating newspaper"". Instead he's training crows to fly bombs through windows. This is what Omar has to deal with. They must strike a decisive blow on their own turf but can any of them strike a match without punching himself in the face? Four incompetent British jihadists set out to train for and commit an act of terror."

Regardless, Alice tries to do whatever necessary to put on appearances of wealth and social standing, despite everyone in that class in town knowing who she is, and thus largely ignoring her because of her false airs.

British heavy metal band Spinal Tap embarks on their biggest tour in the US to date to promote their new album ""Smell The Glove"". The tour is so big that it's attracted the attention of documentary filmmaker Marti DeBergi, who decides to make a movie about Spinal Taps' trek across America. But as the documentary goes along, Spinal Tap sees their audiences dwindle from selling out huge arenas to going to play at charity benefits, and eventually playing private parties where no one pays attention to their music. Their new album drops and it's decently reviewed by critics, but the record stores have a huge problem with the sexist overtones of the album's cover, causing a loss in sales. However, a series of incidents that constantly shoot themselves in the foot - whether it's a minuscule Stonehenge monument, a stage prop malfunction, or a simple two word review of an album - keep preventing the band from enjoying the success they deserve.

She begins within her own church and asks that all women from all churches are brought together. At one meeting, a Muslim woman goes up to the podium to address the church and tells them that she is moved by what they were doing and that Muslim women need to be brought into the Peace Movement. This was a cause that transcended all differences. With this extraordinary mission, the women dressed in plain white clothes and covered their heads, as a way to shed any differences of class or religion among them. They decide to make peace signs and sit in at the fish market where the Liberian president drove past every morning. He refuses to acknowledge them for weeks. The women finally get to present their mission statement to the president, as well as demand peace talks between the government and the rebels. The women do not just hand things over to the men, however. When the peace talks finally come to fruition, a delegate group goes to Ghana to ensure that a resolution is made.

They block all the doors and windows preventing anyone from leaving the peace talks without a resolution. Trapped with no food and water, the talks turn serious. Finally, a resolution is signed. The UN peacekeepers move in and the Liberian president is exiled to Nigeria. The women understood that they could not rely on anyone else to make sure that the resolutions are implemented. They also realize, seeing the UN only creating chaos, that to ensure full disarmament in the country, they would need to step in, forgive their perpetrators, and convince each one of them that they would be accepted back into the community. The truly final mission for the women was to ensure a democratic election and elect a woman into the office of the presidency. The power of the women prevails. The first female president is elected. The women can finally go home. Mission accomplished. Peace reigns in Liberia. A group of women rise up to peace to Liberia and help bring to power the country's first female head of state."

Then Leo meets Colette, the girl of his dreams... on the day she is marrying the perfect man. And so, the ultimate underdog story begins as Leo, a fearless dreamer, risks all to show Colette and the whole wide world all that is right with a man famous for being wrong. Leo Palamino has dedicated his life to what some may call impossible dreams. At least his ex-wife Julie would call them that. But Leo is an expert at not listening to her criticism or anyone else's for that matter because Leo is a stubborn romantic... An idealist. A dreamer. And to dream big, impossible dreams you can't listen to the people who tell you that's what those dreams are. It is precisely this refusal to listen to criticism that drove his ex-wife Julie to blog about Leo's flaws as their relationship broke down. A blog... called Why You Suck that would become a cultural phenomenon. And so when we meet Leo Palamino, he is a romantic dreamer, a dedicated writer, a dishwasher in a tourist trap, and a celebrity... A man famous for his flaws.

COLETTE is on her way into a wedding across the street from Leo's house. Her wedding. Leo the dishwasher falls in love with a bride on the day of her wedding - to another man."
686,1220198.jpeg,,"In 1972, a scale of measurement was established for alien encounters. When a UFO is sighted, it is called an encounter of the first kind. When evidence is collected, it is known as an encounter of the second kind. When contact is made with extraterrestrials, it is the third kind. The next level, abduction, is the fourth kind. Modern-day, Alaska, where-mysteriously since the 1960s-a disproportionate number of the population has been reported missing every year. Despite multiple FBI investigations of the region, the truth has never been discovered. Here in this remote region, psychologist Dr. Abigail Tyler began videotaping sessions with traumatized patients and unwittingly discovered some of the most disturbing evidence of alien abduction ever documented. The Fourth Kind exposes the terrified revelations of multiple witnesses. Their accounts of being visited by alien figures all share disturbingly identical details, the validity of which is investigated throughout the film. After the mysterious death of her beloved husband in Nome, Alaska, the psychologist Abigail Emily Tyler decides to proceed his research with clients that have insomnia and amnesia after seeing a white owl. When she uses hypnosis with two clients, they have nervous breakdown and violent attitudes with their discoveries, but they do not disclose what they have recalled. When Abbey finds that she had also seen the owl, she pushes herself to the edge with tragic consequences. A thriller involving an ongoing unsolved mystery in Alaska, where one town has seen an extraordinary number of unexplained disappearances during the past 40 years and there are accusations of a federal cover up."

When her father dies, Yentl is all alone in the world. She takes the momentous decision to leave the village and - disguised as a boy and calling herself by the name of her late brother, Anshel - seeks and gets admitted to a Yeshiva, to study the texts, traditions, subtleties and complexities of Torah, Talmud, etc. She befriends Avigdor who is engaged to Haddas, but her family discovers his brother committed suicide so they call off the wedding (in case Avigdor possesses the same madness). Anshel then finds ""him""-self in the awkward position of being called into service as substitute bridegroom, so that the wedding can go ahead and Haddas will have a husband. It is a marriage that never gets consummated - apart from the more obvious reasons, because Haddas still wants Avigdor (though she eventually falls in love with Yentl, too). After numerous complications (including Avidor and Yentl falling in love with each other, briefly, after she reveals her secret to him, along with her bosom), the film ends with everybody getting what they always wanted - Haddas and Avigdor to live happily ever after with each other, while Anshel, now Yentl once again, goes off to America to pursue her dream of serious study in Yeshiva, where she will be able to study without needing to hide her identity as a woman.

701,0047849.jpeg,,"From the time John J. Macreedy steps off the train in Black Rock, he feels a chill from the local residents. The town is only a speck on the map and few if any strangers ever come to the place. Macreedy himself is tight-lipped about the purpose of his trip and he finds that the hotel refuses him a room, the local garage refuses to rent him a car and the sheriff is a useless drunkard. It's apparent that the locals have something to hide but when he finally tells them that he is there to speak to a Japanese-American farmer named Kamoko, he touches a nerve so sensitive that he will spend the next 24 hours fighting for his life. When the streamliner stops at Black Rock for the first time in four years, the mysterious one-armed stranger John J. Macreedy disembarks and asks how to reach Adobe Flat to meet the Japanese-American farmer Kamoko. He is not allowed to check-in the hotel and he is not able to rent a car. Soon he notes that the sheriff is a drunkard and the resident Reno Smith rules the place with his henchmen Hector David and Coley Trimble. Further he feels that the inhabitants are hiding something. When he finally succeeds to rent a jeep from Liz Wirth, he drives to Adobe Flat and finds the farmhouse burned to the ground. He immediately concludes what might have happened to Kamoko and tries to communicate with the state police, but he discovers that communication is controlled by Smith. Further, the veterinarian Doc Velie tells that his life is in danger and unsuccessfully tries to help him to escape. Who is John J. Macreedy and what will happen to him? John J. Macreedy doesn't know it, but when he steps off the train at the jerkwater town of Black Rock, he will soon find himself the object of fear, hatred, and even a murder plot! The altruistic Macreedy came to Black Rock to hand over a posthumous military award to a local man whose son had died gallantly in the Second World War. What Macreedy couldn't know when he stepped off of that train was that the town had a shameful secret, one that must be kept at all costs. It's 1945, a couple of weeks after the official end of the war. For the first time in four years, the streamliner stops in the small American western desert town of Black Rock, and off the train steps John J. Macreedy. Wearing a suit, he's a middle aged man with a lame left arm who has never been to Black Rock. Without even knowing who he is or what his story is, the townsfolk are suspicious of Macreedy. They learn that he is only in town for 24 hours when the streamliner will pick him up the next day to take him to Los Angeles, where he will ""restart"" his life. His trip to Black Rock is to speak to a Japanese-American farmer named Komoko who supposedly lives in Adobe Flat. No one in town is willing to help Macreedy locate Komoko. As Macreedy is on his search to find Komoko, he comes to the realization that Reno Smith is the town's leader in whatever they are hiding. Everyone else in town is either in cahoots with Smith, or is unwilling to help for fear of reprisal from Smith and his associates. Those unwilling to help include such influential people as the town's sheriff, the switchboard operator and the telegraph operator. As those in cahoots with Smith try to provoke Macreedy, he also realizes that they are trying to have a reason to kill him. Regardless, Macreedy knows that without help, he will be dead before morning comes as he has no access to either a vehicle or means of communication to the outside world. When he finds out the secret the town is keeping, Macreedy does whatever he needs to save his life and in the process save the town from the scourge that has hung over it for four years. Shortly after the attack on the Pearl Harbor, the unconditional surrender of Japan, and the resultant hatred towards Japanese-Americans, one-armed John J. Macreedy alights at Black Rock from a train in order to give a medal to the last known relative, Komoko, of a deceased Japanese-American army officer, Joe. His attempts to do so will pit him against the entire town - including the Sheriff himself - that is intent on covering up a dark secret; attempts will be made to run him off the road while driving; he will be threatened, and the telephone operator will refuse to connect him to the State Police; the Railway Station's employee will not dispatch a telegram; while the local Mortician will warn him that he should prepare for his death by nightfall. A one-handed stranger comes to a tiny town possessing a terrible past they want to keep secret, by violent means if necessary."

In London 1938 on the Chinese New Year, Crystal Shackleford has such an idol and decides to put the legend to the test. She picks two random strangers off the street, and puts the proposition to them. They decide that an ideal wish would be for a sweepstakes ticket they buy equal shares in to be a winner. After all, everyone needs money and a pot is very easy to divide equally, right? 1938 London. A young woman is able to coerce two men, total strangers, up to her flat. She doesn't disclose the reason for doing so until they are both there. She has a statue of Kwan Yin, a Chinese goddess of fortune and destiny, and of life and death, which she believes is able to grant one wish to three strangers on the stroke of midnight on Chinese New Year, which is just minutes away. She has a specific wish she wants granted, one she knows the other two would have no interest in, so she suggests the three make a wish for money, which would be a means to her end. Figuring they have nothing to lose, the two men agree, the actual method of that money being a sweepstakes ticket for a future horse race, which one of the men has in his possession, he only wanting two-thirds of the ticket's nominal cost from them for using it in this wish. They also agree that if the ticket is chosen, they will let the entire amount ride on the outcome of the race. It isn't until after the stroke of midnight that they learn only each others' names, and scant bits about their lives. She is Crystal Shackleford, who wants to use the money to prove to her husband, from who she is separated, that she is not after his money, leading to a reconciliation. The original owner of the sweepstakes ticket is Johnny West, who is in hiding as he, while drunk (a state he is in more often than not), was involved in a three-man robbery that led to the death of a policeman. One of the men is standing trial for the robbery and murder - he not giving up the other two - while the other is also in hiding with Johnny. The other stranger is barrister Jerome K. Arbutny, whose largest current file is handling the trust of wealthy Lady Rhea Belladon following the death of her husband, Lord Belladon. The power of Kwan Yin will be proved not only if the ticket is chosen and their horse wins the race, but also if the actions of the three strangers has no consequence on their lives in relation to this wish. Three strangers, each with a serious problem in their lives, share a sweepstakes ticket which they wished upon together before a Chinese idol."

After a dispute of lands judged by the church, her husband John Bell is cursed by his opponent Kathe Batts, who has a fame of being a witch. From this moment on, an entity threatens John and her daughter Betsy Bell, attacking the girl during the nights. With the support of Betsy's school teacher Richard Powell, who tries to find rational explanations for the manifestation; her brother John Bell Jr.; and their friend James Johnston, who unsuccessfully tries to exorcize the entity from the house, the family does their best to protect Betsy in the haunted house. Based on a local Tennessee folklore legend. With over 20 books written on the subject, and a town that still lives in fear of the return of the unseen spirit, the story of ""An American Haunting"" is terrifying. Between the years 1818-1820, the Bell Family of Red River, Tennessee was visited by an unknown presence that haunted the family and eventually ended up causing the death of one its members. Starting with small sounds around the farm, and the sighting of a a strange BLACK WOLF with piercing yellow eyes, the sounds escalated into full brutal contact with the certain family members, causing psychological and physical torment. The attacks grew in strength, with the spirit slapping, pulling, dragging, and beating the Bell's youngest daughter. The Bells searched for rational explanations and ways to rid their house of this entity, but to no avail as the spirit began to communicate with them through sounds, and eventually multiple voices that sounded like the wind. The cause of its actions could always be felt, but no being could be seen, and no explanation found- only the promise that one day it would kill one of the family members. Fearing that the haunting was caused by a local woman -branded a witch- who had put a curse upon the family as a result of a land dispute, the Bells tried desperately to find ways to get rid of the woman's curse, yet the attacks and disturbances only escalated. It was not until a manuscript of the local schoolteacher -who lived on the property during the disturbance- was found in 1998 that the horrifying and shocking answer to what caused this haunting would finally be unveiled. Based on the true events of the only case in US History where a spirit caused the death of a man."

He is a successful writer of a series of what he considers ""pulp fiction"" detective novels, but has just written his first serious novel - one he doesn't admit to anyone is semi-autobiographical in that its lead character is a man trying to rise to greatness out of mediocrity - which is being panned by the critics, with his fans refusing to read it. He is dating twenty-five year old record company executive Bernadette, the two of them who live in separate generations and as such don't really understand each other. As Patti, Brian, Kate and Murph reconnect, the questions become whether there is a second life for them as couples, and specifically for Patti and Brian if their reconnection can elevate them into being the writers they truly want to be. Patti Petalson (Blair) struggles with the pressure of becoming the next important American writer."

Sebastien and Alain go to the Hotel Chevre D'Or, where they find the victim's ID, which shows that his name was Mikhail Suverov, and Mikhail was born on the exact same day Alain was born on. Mikhail was on his way to the street where Alain's home is located. Mikhail had come to Nice from New York City. Alain visits his mother Chantal, and tells Chantal about this case. Chantal confesses that Mikhail was Alain's twin brother, and Chantal had given Mikhail up for adoption. Mikhail had been on his way to introduce himself to Alain when Mikhail was murdered.

Davis drops Alain off at a hotel. Alex goes to the hotel and up to Alain's room. Alain tells Alex that he's not Mikhail, and that Mikhail was murdered. Ivan and two of his men show up.

Davis stops the cab, and Alain gets out of the cab to check on Davis, who dies in Alain's arms. Alex tells Alain that Mikhail once told her that he had a plan that would get him out of the Russian mafia. Alex tells Alain that Ivan won't stop until they are both dead, and that Ivan and his boss, Dmitri Kirov, who has FBI agents Pellman and Loomis in his pocket, are relentless.

Louise eventually does become ""Gypsy"", and Rose is left by herself, her aspirations for her kids realized, but her own show-business aspirations still unrealized.

The train meets with an accident, and after recuperating, Ashoke re-locates to America, settles down, returns home in 1977 to get married to aspiring singer, Ashima, and returns home to New York. Shortly thereafter they become parents of a boy, who they initially name Gogol, and a few years later both give birth to Sonia. The family then buy their own house in the suburbs and travel to India for the first time after their marriage. The second time they travel to India is when Gogol and Sonia are in their late teens, and after a memorable visit to Kolkata and then to the Taj Mahal, they return home. Gogol falls in love with Maxine Ratliff and moves in with her family, while Ashoke spends time traveling, and Sonia moves to California, leaving Ashima all her by herself. The Ganguli family will be destined to travel to India again soon - this time under very different circumstances - and after all have endured life-changing events. In 1977, Ashima, a young Bengali woman, accepts Ashoke's marriage proposal. He's a student living abroad, so after the marriage she accompanies him to New York, where their temporary residence becomes permanent. We see her navigate and adapt to this alien land. They name their son Nikhil, with the pet name of Gogol, after Ashoke's favorite writer. We watch Gogol grow up American with roots he only begins to appreciate when he visits India in his 20s.

American-born Gogol, the son of Indian immigrants, wants to fit in among his fellow New Yorkers, despite his family's unwillingness to let go of their traditional ways."

However, what Dr. Brown has come to tell Phoebe is that he has enlisted in the army to fight in the Napoleonic Wars, with no mention of any romantic feeling for her from his side.

Heartbroken, Phoebe, if only for herself, decides to regain some of her youth by paying attention to her appearance, which she has not done in quite some time. As Captain Brown does not recognize the remade Phoebe as the Phoebe he now knows, Patty, Phoebe and Susan's maid, makes an impromptu decision and introduces Phoebe as Livvie, Phoebe and Susan's visiting niece.

The wedding itself proves to be anything but a hasty affair--the guest list quickly blooms from 75 to 200 guests, and Carrie's simple, label-less wedding gown gives way to an enormous creation that makes her look like a gigantic cream puff. An upcoming photo spread in Vogue puts the event--which will take place at the New York Public Library--squarely in the public eye. Meanwhile, Carrie's girlfriends--Samantha, the sexpot; Charlotte, the sweet naïf; and Miranda, the rigid perfectionist--could not be happier. At least, they couldn't be happier for Carrie. Charlotte still has the unrealized hope of getting pregnant. Samantha is finding a loving, committed relationship more grueling than she could have imagined. Miranda unwittingly lets her own unhappiness--created when Steve admits to cheating on her just once--spoil Carrie's. After a heated encounter with Steve, she happens to spot Mr. Big and tells him he's crazy to get married. She's really only thinking of her own marriage. But her angry remark gets Mr. Big to thinking.

A perfect life. As long as neither woman decides to follow him to the other port. Henry St. James, captain of a large ferry that shuttles between the British colony in Gibraltar and the Spanish-ruled peninsula of Ceuta in northern Morocco, is a man who covertly maintains a wife at one port, and a mistress at another. For security reasons, access to Gibraltar is restricted and the only member of the Golden Fleece's crew eligible for shore leave is St. James, so the likelihood of St. James' women meeting is remote despite their relatively close proximity. Each woman represents a different aspect of womanhood that the captain finds attractive. Maud in Gibraltar is a dutiful wife and housekeeper, a good cook, and a faithful homebody, while Nita in Morocco is a voluptuously sexy siren who appeals to his more hedonistic nature which loves dancing and drinking until dawn. Trouble in Paradise begins when Maud begins to crave a more carefree existence and Nita longs to develop her domestic skills. The bigamist captain of a ferry boat between the restricted British colony in Gibraltar and Spanish Morocco has a woman of differing appeal and temperament in each port."

Ex-military man Jim Field, married with three high school aged daughters, wants to portray having the perfect, loving family to the outside world, which is anything but reality largely based on his behavior and thus relationships with the other family members. While trying to be what he considers the model father, he cheats on his wife and is a bit of a blowhard. A prime example of his behavior was several years earlier canceling a family vacation to Disneyland impromptu in favor of a two week nuclear attack simulation, taking the family to live during that time in the locked bomb shelter in their backyard.

Each of the girls tries to deal with their family dysfunction in different ways. Norma, the Plain Jane self-conscious one who truly wants a loving relationship with her parents the most of the three, tries to hold the family together in maintaining the house while secretly harboring family memories which no one else in the family will talk about. Lou has always been the rebellious one, she most openly showing her anger toward her father, who she considers a tyrant. In her own world, Sandy models herself after the typical 1950s housewife.

962,0884328.jpeg,,"Everyone thinks of it as a harmless lightning storm. When Dave Drayton notices a strange mist on the lake, he thinks nothing of it. When he, his son, Billy Drayton, and his neighbor Brent Norton travel to the supermarket, the unthinkable happens. On their way to the market, they see the army, firefighters, and the police heading toward the mist. When he sees this Brent mentions something about ""Project Arrowhead"", a secret military project that no one knows about. As they are shopping, they see three soldiers walk in, pick up a few things, then head toward the mist. All eighty of the store's shoppers have no clue what is going on until an old man runs in the market with a bloody nose and declares ""Something in the mist!"" He tells them to close the door. About five seconds after they close the door, the entire store shakes, as though it has been lifted several feet above the ground. When David is asked to check on the generator, he finds the loading dock door being pushed on by something outside. Then Dave hears a groan. He asks three people to come with him. When Norm the bag-boy volunteers to go out, he is dragged away by a creature with large squid-like tentacles that have mouths, teeth, and arms. After Dave and the other three fight off the tentacles, they warn everyone in the store what is out there. Upon hearing this, Mrs. Carmody exclaims that it is the End Time and that God is punishing them. People don't believe it, but finally Mrs. Carmody has almost everyone in the store on her side. Does 'Project Arrowhead' have anything to do with this? Will Dave Drayton, his son, and his friends make it out alive as they make a last stand against this destruction? Or will they be taken by the demon-like creatures of 'The Mist'? A violent storm hits a town in Maine, then an approaching cloud of mist appears the next morning. As the mist quickly envelops the area, a group of people get trapped in a local grocery store, among them, artist David Drayton and his five-year-old son. The people soon discover that within the mist lives numerous species of horrific, unworldly creatures that entered through an inter-dimensional rift, possibly caused by a project on a nearby military base. As the world around them turns into a literal Hell-on-earth, the horrified citizens try desperately to survive this apocalyptic disaster. After a violent storm in a community in Maine, the local artist Dave Drayton drives from his lake-side house with his son Billy and his arrogant neighbor, lawyer Brent Norton, to the supermarket to get supplies. On the way, they see a heavy mist, and later, see military convoys, police, fire trucks, and ambulances heading into it. In the supermarket, a frantic local arrives crying that there is something alive in the mist. The manager closes the front entrance but the store is enclosed by the mist. David, another client and two employees go to the back of the store to start the backup generator. When they open the back entrance, Norm the cashier (Chris Owen) is seized and dragged away by fierce tentacles. David and two survivors succeed in closing the loading door. When they tell the rest of the people in the store what happened, Brent does not trust his own perception, believing it is a prank. The God-fearing Mrs. Carmody preaches the Apocalypse and says that she is the agent of the Lord on Earth. Soon the group discovers that they are under siege by blood-thirsty creatures from another dimension that have reached our planet through a window opened by a failed military research project. The crazy Mrs. Carmody has many followers and starts to make dangerous speeches. Absent any alternatives, a small group led by David decides to take a chance, leave the supermarket, and get to his car, hoping to escape the mist. A freak storm unleashes a species of blood-thirsty creatures on a small town, where a small band of citizens hole up in a supermarket and fight for their lives."

He enjoys his run at the top, and has for the last five years. And his news team is equally as good as he is. Professional jock and former professional baseball player Champ Kind handles the sports, the curiously dim witted Brick Tamland - who's a few channels short of a cable subscription - handles the weather, and ladies' man Brian Fantana - whose collection of fine scents would be in the Guinness Book Of Records - handles the on-field reporting. But now all that is about to change forever. The TV station Burgundy works for, Channel 4, has embraced diversity and has hired a beautiful new female anchor named Veronica Corningstone. While Ron Burgundy and the rest of the Channel 4 news team enjoys fighting with competitors, drinking, and flirting with the ladies, Veronica quietly climbs her way to the top. And Veronica's success drives Ron Burgundy crazy. So much that Veronica's meddling causes Ron to get demoted and ultimately lose his job with Channel 6. Now left with nothing, Ron must find a way to get back to the top - and that involves a story about a rare Chinese panda giving birth on US soil. Will Ron be the one to report the story on a national level? Set in the 70s, Ron Burgundy is the top rated newsman of San Diego's male-dominated Channel 4. Veronica Corningstone, who joins this news channel, is more than just a sex object; she's determined to be a news anchor. And no, she's not kidding, unlike what Ron Burgundy thought as a ""funny joke"". As Ron becomes increasingly jealous of her popularity, the animosity between them gets bigger. Ron Burgundy is the top-rated anchorman in San Diego in the '70s. When feminism marches into the newsroom in the form of ambitious newswoman Veronica Corningstone, Ron is willing to play along at first-as long as Veronica stays in her place, covering cat fashion shows, cooking, and other ""female"" interests. But when Veronica refuses to settle for being eye candy and steps behind the news desk, it's more than a battle between two perfectly coiffed anchor-persons... it's war. It's the 1970s as San Diego anchorman Ron Burgundy is the top dog in local TV, which gives way to his freewheeling sexism with his fraternal-like crew. But all that's about to change (or be jeopardized) when ambitious reporter Veronica Corningstone has just arrived as a new employee at his TV station. Ron Burgundy is San Diego's top rated newsman in the male-dominated broadcasting of the '70s, but that's all about to change for Ron and his cronies when an ambitious woman is hired as a new anchor."

Their sons, the teenager Walt and the boy Frank, feel the separation and take side: Walt stays with Bernard, and Frank with Joan, and both are affected with abnormal behaviors.

As such, they announce to Walt and Frank that they are separating after seventeen years of marriage, that Bernard has taken another apartment five subway stops away, and that Bernard and Joan will have joint and equal time custody of the two boys. The boys don't much like this situation, not so much because of their parents' break-up, but because they more closely resemble and thus associate with one parent, and would rather live with that parent to the exclusion of the other: Walt with Bernard, and Frank with Joan.

Further information from Berlin comes to light that Julia could never have been on board. Kyle is certain that someone on board has taken her and that someone with the airline who could alter official flight records is also involved in her disappearance.

994,0057590.jpeg,,"In eighteenth century England, ""first cousins"" Tom Jones and Master Blifil grew up together in privilege in the western countryside, but could not be more different in nature. Tom, the bastard son of one of Squire Allworthy's servants Jenny Jones and the local barber Partridge, was raised by virtuous Allworthy as his own after he sent Jenny away. Tom is randy, chasing anything in a skirt, he's having a sexual relationship on the sly with Molly Seagrim, the peasant daughter of Allworthy's gamekeeper. Tom is nonetheless kind-hearted and good-natured, he who is willing to defend that and those in which he believes. Blifil, on the other hand, is dour, and although outwardly pious, is cold-hearted and vengeful. Despite his randiness, Tom eventually falls in love with Sophie Western, who has just returned to the area after a few years abroad. Despite Sophie's love for Tom, Squire Western and his spinster sister would rather see Sophie marry Blifil rather than a bastard, who Western nonetheless liked before he knew that Tom liked Sophie.

While Sophie sneaks away in search of Tom, and Squire Western and Miss Western go off in search of Sophie, Tom gets into one misadventure after another on his way to London, some involving his randiness, and some which will reveal certain aspects of his life previously unknown to him.

It seems that her new boyfriend works for some criminals. After being arrested, the government offers to let him enter the newly developed Witness Protection Program in exchange for testifying against his employers. His bosses instruct him to marry his girlfriend so that she can't testify against him, they promise that they will take care of her. When he learns that they have done nothing, he accepts the government's offer. So, he and his wife and her children enter the program. Now her ex-husband goes to a lawyer because he wants to sue the government for keeping him away from his children. In 1960's Buffalo, New York, divorced Thomas Hacklin, Jr. is an honest, hard working working class stiff who adores his two young children, Andy and Junie, more than anything in the world. His ex-wife Ruthie has custody of the children, but Tom has all the access he wants to them. Tom doesn't like Ruthie's new boyfriend, Jack Scolese, and Jack spending time with his children, but he isn't quite sure what it is about Jack he doesn't like. Indeed, Jack is a low level mobster trying to make his way up, which he attempts to do by masterminding a major daytime bank robbery. It doesn't go quite the way Jack envisions as his mob bosses provide him no support in the matter. So Tom is not happy when he learns of the robbery, Jack's arrest and the fact that Ruthie has married him. Sam Marzetta of the Buffalo PD and Jason Reid of the Justice Department convince Jack to testify against his mob bosses in return for protection for him and his new family in the witness relocation program. So one day when Tom routinely goes to pick up his children from Ruthie's, he finds that all three have vanished without a trace. He eventually does learn that the authorities have in a sense taken away his children. With the help and advice from his new girlfriend and eventual second wife Ali, Tom uses whatever means possible - including legal and political - to find his children. The police won't even talk to him until he starts legal proceedings to sue them and the government. But when these proper channels don't seem to be getting him anywhere, he decides he needs to take matters into his own hands, which isn't easy as the authorities do whatever they can to hide Jack, Ruthie and kids from Tom, while the mob does whatever it can, including using Tom, to find Jack."

1048,0056255.jpeg,,"St. Louis based banker Roger Hobbs is writing a letter to his wife, Peggy Hobbs, about his true feelings concerning their just returned from month long vacation, the letter to be opened only after his death, whenever that may be. Mr. Hobbs wanted the vacation to be a romantic getaway for two, but Peggy insisted that it be a family vacation to a central California beach-side house, given to them for the month by friends. The vacation included all their offspring, and their offspring's respective families where applicable. Hobbs hated the idea as he felt he didn't know his offspring - and their spouses even less - and that they, in turn, no longer needed him. They include: daughter Susan Carver, who, with her husband, Stan Carver, have a permissive parenting style as per the latest child psychology books; daughter Janie Grant, whose husband, college professor, Byron Grant, has an academic view of everything in life; fourteen year old daughter, Katey Hobbs, who is self conscious around boys if only because of her new braces, that self consciousness which boys see as standoffishness; and preteen son Danny Hobbs, whose sole focus in life is watching television. The house ended up being a rat trap which exasperated their cook Brenda the most. But beyond that issue, Mr. Hobbs ended up learning the true nature of his relationship to his offspring and to Peggy. In the process, he had to endure the extended visit by an odd couple named the Turners, and learned that some problems can be solved purely by yelling ""hey Joe"" into an unknown group of boys. Hobbs is in desperate need of a holiday and is very much hoping he and his wife Peggy can get away on their own. He gets home to learn that she's accepted the offer of friend's house on the beach and is hoping all of their children and grandchildren will be able to join them for the month they will be there. When they arrive they find a dilapidated house with an antiquated plumbing system. Those are the least of Hobbs' problem however. His young son is only interested in watching television and his teenage daughter is having to deal with wearing braces. Of his two eldest daughters, one is seemingly on he verge of a divorce and the other suspects her husband's loyalties. Throughout it all, Hobbs takes life in stride providing fatherly advice. Roger Hobbs is a harried city dweller who longs to take his family to the seashore for a vacation. He and his wife Peggy do get the family to the sand, but new problems develop there, and the vacation turns out to be a mixed blessing. Mr Hobbs longs for a vacation alone with his wife, away from his long commute into work and his disfunctional family. His wife longs for a family get-together. Of course the wife wins and off to the beach with the family they go. Mr. Hobbs wants to spend a quiet holiday at the beach, but his wife has invited all their family to stay with them."

1050,0087928.jpeg,,"The year is 1984 and the mayoress has removed set personal criteria form the requirements to join the police force. No longer is sex, weight, height and orientation a factor. This now allows for an insurgence of people applying. The Police Academy series follows a select group of misfits in their quest to become police men and women. The first film of the series follows these misfits in their time at the Police Academy. The main focus is on a petty criminal called Mahoney. Mahoney is busted for criminal damage and as punishment is forced to go to Police Academy. Mahoney initially feels that this isn't the right place for him and he makes it his mission to be thrown out as he is not allowed to quit. As the classes go by and the training exercises are played out, Mahoney soon realizes that he is actually enjoying the academy and does want to become a police officer. We are also introduced to the gun maniac Tackelberry, the very tall Hightower, voluptuous Callahan, squeaky Hooks, human beat box and sound effects master Jones and the ever confuzzled Commandant Lassard. This group become good friends and become the base for the rest of the series of films. New rules enforced by the Lady Mayoress mean that sex, weight, height and intelligence need no longer be a factor for joining the Police Force. This opens the floodgates for all and sundry to enter the Police Academy, much to the chagrin of the instructors. Not everyone is there through choice, though. Social misfit Mahoney has been forced to sign up as the only alternative to a jail sentence and it doesn't take long before he falls foul of the boorish Lieutenant Harris. But before long, Mahoney realises that he is enjoying being a police cadet and decides he wants to stay... while Harris decides he wants Mahoney out! As a crime wave sweeps through a city that doesn't have enough police officers, the mayor decides that part of the problem may stem from overly restrictive qualifications for police officers, so she opens the door of the city's Police Academy to anyone who wants to join. Chief Henry Hurst does not agree with the mayor's decision. Soon, the academy is overrun with misfits, including parking lot attendant Carey Mahoney, who has been arrested before. Captain Reed, a longtime friend of Mahoney's father, gives Mahoney the choice of taking the 14 week course and joining the force, or going to jail. Mahoney chooses the academy. Karen Thompson is an attractive cadet whom Mahoney has his eyes on. Florist Moses Hightower is a mountain of a man who likes to tend flowers. And Larvell Jones has the ability to imitate the sound of virtually anything. Also in the academy are guy-magnet Debbie Callahan, squeaky voiced Laverne Hooks, gun loving Eugene Tackleberry, and Leslie Barbara (Donovan Scott), a cadet who has been picked on one too many times. Befuddled Commandant Eric Lassard and his lackey, Lieutenant Thaddeus Harris, are not exactly thrilled with the new recruits. As Lassard and Harris try to wash their hands of the recruits, Mahoney and his classmates become all the more determined to make good, even when one of the recruits accidentally starts a chain reaction of fights that lead to a riot in the city. The city is in need of more police officers, so the mayor decides to alter the requirements for acceptance into the Police Academy. Among the new cadets is Moses Hightower, a gentle giant who was a florist. Leslie Barbara, who is tired of being picked on. Laverne Hooks, a mousy, meek voice person. Karen Thompson, a socialite, who hopes that it'll allow her the opportunity to meet some unusual people. Eugene Tackleberry, a guy who likes to discharge his weapon. Larvell Jones, a human sound effects machine, who was met at the police station by Carey Mahoney, a guy who is basically a good guy but has a little trouble with authority figures, a retaliates by committing outrageous acts that get him arrested. He is fortunate that police Captain Reed is a good friend of his father and has been bailing him out but now Reed thinks that jail is what Mahoney needs but Mahoney disagrees. Reed suggest that Mahoney join the police academy but must complete the 14 week course or else he will be sent to jail. So Mahoney brings Jones with him hoping that he can help Mahoney get thrown out. It also seems that the police chief doesn't agree with the mayor so he instructs Commandant Lassard and Lieutenant Harris to encourage the bad apples to quit. A group of good-hearted but incompetent misfits enter the police academy, but the instructors there are not going to put up with their pranks."

Most people think they know the ""McDonald's coffee case,"" but what they don't know is that corporations have spent millions distorting the case to promote tort reform.

1078,0070895.jpeg,,"A surprise hit when it premiered, Walking Tall carried the theme of one man standing up for his sense of right and wrong. Selmer, a small town in southwest Tennessee, served as the authentic background for the bio-pic of the heroic southern Sheriff. Joe Don Baker did an admirable job with the role, and the hugely violent film was a surprise hit. Former Sheriff Pusser himself was set to potray himself in the sequel, but he died in a car crash as he as returning from his contract signing in California. The sequel was filmed using Swedish actor Bo Swensen, and a Final Chapter triquel told of Pussers' demise. While the Walking Tall franchise will never be on any list of Classic Film, the original is a great slice of Americana, Circa '70s. It made Bakers' career and perhaps kicked the 'southsploutation' genre of that decade into gear. Buford Pusser's a wrestler, whose wife wants him to settle down, so they go to his home town in Tennessee, where he plans to get into business with his father. But he is shocked to discover all sorts of graft and corruption going on. And when he is a victim of it and decides to strike back by running against the corrupt sheriff.

Jim may face further obstacles in his new life if he were ever to meet anyone who knew or knew of Jim Fontaine.

1121,0301727.jpeg,,"This documentary follows several species of migratory birds over a four year filming period. These birds travel several hundreds if not thousands of miles toward the equator in the autumn, and make the return journey to their higher latitude summer homes in the spring, always taking the same route, using the natural compasses of the universe, the stars, to find their way. Some species, like the arctic tern, even fly from pole to pole. These long and often torturous treks are a matter of survival, to live in a hospitable climate and find sources of food. With the exception of migratory penguins, travel over oceans is especially difficult as the birds have little refuge unless there is something floating on the water, such as a ship, on which to land. Otherwise they must continue flying until they reach land. Some will not survive the migration due to predators, including man, illness or injury. Although the migrations themselves are done as a community, once the birds reach their respective summer and winter homes, they disperse into family units. And every continent is affected by the migration as every continent is home, at least part of year, to a species of migratory bird. The cameras of Jacques Perrin fly with migratory birds: geese, storks, cranes. The film begins with spring in France and the migration to the Arctic; the flight is a community event for each species. Once in the Arctic, it's family time: courtship, nests, eggs, fledglings, and first flight. Chicks must soon fly south through Europe and North America. Bad weather, hunters, and pollution take their toll. Then, the cameras go south over the Sahara; South Africa is the winter destination. The search for food, good weather, and a place to hatch young takes this annual cycle of stamina across continents and oceans. There is a spare narration and a few titles; for the most part it's visual, a bird's eye view. Documentary on the migratory patterns of birds, shot over the course of three years on all seven continents."

Warriors from Asgard stop them but their leader Malekith escapes to wait for another opportunity. The warriors find the Aether and since it cannot be destroyed, they try to hide it. In the present day, Jane Foster awaits the return of Thor although it has been two years since they last saw once another. In the meantime, Thor has been trying to bring peace to the nine realms. Jane discovers an anomaly similar to the one that brought Thor to Earth. She goes to investigate, finds a wormhole, and is sucked into it. Back on Asgard, Thor wishes to return to Earth but his father, Odin refuses to let him. Thor learns from Heimdall, who can see into all of the realms, that Jane disappeared. Thor then returns to Earth just as Jane reappears. However, when some policemen try to arrest her, an unknown energy repulses them. Thor then brings Jane to Asgard to find out what happened to her. When the energy is released again, they discover that when Jane disappeared, she crossed paths with the Aether and it entered her. Malekith, upon sensing that the time to strike is now, seeks out the Aether. He attacks Asgard and Thor's mother Frigga is killed protecting Jane. Odin wants to keep Jane on Asgard so that Malekith will come. Thor disagrees with his plan, so with his cohorts, he decides to take Jane away. He enlists the aid of his brother, Loki. Unfortunately, Loki's motivations remain unknown. There are nine realms of Asgard and once every 5,000 years they align. Earth happens to be one of these realms. These realms create portals between the worlds during the alignment which is called ""Convergence"". On Earth, in London, Jane Foster believes she and her crew have discovered one such portal. Foster, while investigating the phenomenon, is transported to another realm and comes in contact with a substance called Aether. Upon coming into contact with the substance, it draws Thor from Asgard back to Earth. Thor takes Jane to Asgard to be cured from the Aether. Unfortunately in doing so it draws more than just Jane to that world. Another being called Malekith wants to use the Aether to destroy Asgard. Devising a plan with his brother - the war criminal Loki, Thor heads to ""The Dark World"" to destroy the Aether and save Asgard. But can Loki be trusted? Odin recalls when his father Bor and the warriors from Asgard vanquished the evil Dark Elves and their leader Malekith that wanted to send the universe into the darkness during the convergence of nine realms unleashing the powerful weapon Aether.

As Dysart exposes the truths behind the boy's demons, he finds himself face-to-face with his own. Despite being already overworked, Dr. Martin Dysart, head of a psychiatric hospital, agrees to the request of his friend, Magistrate Hesther Saloman, personally to work on the case of seventeen year old Alan Strang, charged with blinding six horses with a metal spike at the stables where he worked one day a week as a stable boy. The blindings are despite Alan supposedly having had an affinity with horses since he was a child and his first exposure to a horse at age six. Alan will be housed at the hospital, where Martin will have a daily session with him until he gets back to Hesther with his professional findings, with the hopeful end goal being for Alan to return to being a ""normal"" boy.

Initially in Martin and Alan's sessions, Alan wants to portray himself as being crazy by singing commercial jingles when asked anything. Although not without incidents along the way, Alan does begin to open up about himself in their sessions. What happens between Martin and Alan is affected by and affects Martin personally: his thoughts about his profession and his somewhat cold and childless marriage to his dentist wife, Margaret.

1199,0066999.jpeg,,"In the year 1971, San Francisco faces the terror of a maniac known as Scorpio- who snipes at innocent victims and demands ransom through notes left at the scene of the crime. Inspector Harry Callahan (known as Dirty Harry by his peers through his reputation handling of homicidal cases) is assigned to the case along with his newest partner Inspector Chico Gonzalez to track down Scorpio and stop him. Using humiliation and cat and mouse type of games against Callahan, Scorpio is put to the test with the cop with a dirty attitude. 1971. San Francisco is under the terrorizing eye of a psychopathic sniper called Scorpio, and claims in one of his written letters to the SFPD, that he will keep killing until his demands are made. Inspector 'Dirty' Harry Callahan is a San Francisco police officer, with a dirty attitude and uses little methods to what the law prescribes. It becomes a menacing task for Callahan, as he's been assigned to apprehend the menacing killer at all cost, which later unravels into a cat-and-mouse game between the two men. One killer with a sinister, distasteful laughter. The other, a killer with just a plain dirty attitude who holds the badge. The downfall of societal coddling of criminals is the theme of the debut of Inspector Harry Callahan, who has no patience for criminals and less of such for revolving-door justice as well as politicians who wilt under the pressure of a deranged hippie who uses a sniper rifle to kill several innocent people, only to go free because the incrimating rifle was obtained by an ""illegal"" search. Harry must break societal rules to stop the madman society allows to roam free. The debut of SFPD Inspector Harry Callahan begins with a sociopathic rooftop sniper killing a young woman in a pool, and then trying to extort $100,000 from the City. Harry is asked by his boss, Lt. Bressler and the Mayor to put a stop to this low-life. While Harry & his new partner, Chico investigate, another murder occurs, followed by a kidnapping/rape of a young girl, and a subsequent attempt at extortion by the killer, who calls himself 'Scorpio'. Harry volunteers to deliver the ransom but is nearly killed by Scorpio, who is wounded & driven off by Chico and Harry. Harry follows the suspect's trail to Kezar Stadium, where he discovers the murder weapon and the suspect! The man is arrested and Harry gets the girl's location out of him. Unbeknownst to Harry, the girl is dead already, and the next morning Harry visits the D.A. to find out that the man is being freed - because of a bleeding-heart legal system and judiciary that says Harry's search was 'illegal', although there was no time - and no judge - to get a warrant from. On his release, Scorpio is up to his old tricks - this time he kidnaps a bus-load of children and demands a ransom. The Mayor foolishly goes along with Scorpio's game and orders Harry not to stop the killer. Disgusted with the weak-kneed attitude of the Mayor & his colleagues in the legal system, Harry intercepts the bus and takes on Scorpio himself to put an end to the kidnapping and the psychopath's reign of terror...for good. San Francisco is being terrorized by a sniper who calls himself Scorpio, and Scorpio kills Diana Davidson as she swims in a pool. Inspector Harry Callahan is known as Dirty Harry. Dirty Harry is a widower, his wife having been killed in an auto accident. He lives to make the existence of his superiors a miserable one, and he refuses to play by the rules. Dirty Harry doesn't wear Kevlar and he doesn't carry an arsenal of automatic weapons. All he needs is his .44 magnum. Six shots doesn't seem like much, but it's enough when you rarely miss and a single shot can knock you into the next millennium. Dirty Harry handles the search for Scorpio, and ends up stopping three men from robbing a bank. Known for bringing bad luck to his partners, Dirty Harry reluctantly accepts new partner Chico Gonzalez on the orders of Lieutenant Al Bressler. Dirty Harry even gets chewed out by the mayor. Scorpio promises to kill a black person and a priest if the city doesn't give him $100,000. Nearly caught, Scorpio doubles the ransom, kidnaps a 14-year-old girl, and buries her alive, giving the police a limited time to cough up the money before she suffocates. Dirty Harry follows Scorpio's instructions for the delivery, which results in Chico getting wounded. Dirty Harry tracks Scorpio to Kezar Stadium, the home of the San Francisco 49ers. Scorpio is running across the football field, and Dirty Harry calmly takes aim and nails him in the leg at the 50-yard line. The shot lifts him up and flips him over. Dirty Harry tortures Scorpio into revealing the girl's hiding place. She's found dead and Scorpio is released due to Dirty Harry's unorthodox procedure. Later, Scorpio takes over a school bus. And Dirty Harry is the only one who can take Scorpio down. When a mad man calling himself 'the Scorpio Killer' menaces the city, tough as nails San Francisco Police Inspector Harry Callahan is assigned to track down and ferret out the crazed psychopath."

Later when several witnesses under Witsec are killed, Kruger accompanies another Witsec agent Deguerin to save a potential victim, when they get there, Deguerin shoots the killer but also kills the witness, and then plants a photo of Lee in the shooter's pocket. When Kruger sees the photo, Deguerin asks where she is, Kruger intially gives him a false location but while on the plane, Kruger sensing something's not right, calls her, which means that she is suppose to meet him somewhere. Kruger's drugged and when he awakens he discovers that Deguerin is not only working with the people who are trying to sell the weapons but has just framed him for killing another agent. Kruger escapes and gets to Lee in time but unfortunately, he is still a fugitive, so he must try and prove his innocence while trying to protect Lee.

The Freelings are a typical suburban family. Husband Steve sells real estate in their ever expanding subdivision and Diane is a stay at home mom caring for their three kids, Dana, Robbie and little Carol Anne. Strange things being to happen in the house however: cupboard doors open on their own, furniture rearranges itself and chairs go sliding across the kitchen floor. It's a bit of whimsy at first but soon becomes deadly serious when Carol Anne vanishes into a nether world where, oddly, she can only be communicated with through the white noise on their television. A team of paranormal investigators move into the house but the forces that kidnapped are evil and powerful requiring the services of Tangina, a woman who has dealt with this situation before. Life is very pleasant for the close-knit Freeling family until a host of otherworldly forces invades their peaceful suburban home. It starts with just an odd occurrence or two, but soon their house is turned into a swirling supernatural sideshow. The forces at work are anything but friendly, and if the luckless Freelings don't clear out soon, they'll all be swept off into nightmarish chaos! Craig T. Nelson stars as Steve Freeling, the main protagonist, who lives with his wife, Diane, (JoBeth Williams) and their three children, Dana (Dominique Dunne), Robbie (Oliver Robins), and Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke), in Southern California where he sells houses for the company that built the neighborhood. It starts with just a few odd occurrences, such as broken dishes and furniture moving around by itself. However, a tree comes alive and takes Robbie through his bedroom window, and Carol Anne is abducted by ghosts. Realizing that something evil haunts his home, Steve calls in a team of parapsychologists led by Dr. Lesh (Beatrice Straight) to investigate, hoping to get Carol Anne back, so he can remove his family from the house before it's too late. While living an an average family house in a pleasant neighborhood, the youngest daughter of the Freeling family, Carol Anne, seems to be connecting with the supernatural through a dead channel on the television.

At first seeming like harmless ghosts, they play tricks and amuse the family, but they take a nasty turn- they horrify the family to death with angry trees and murderous dolls, and finally abduct Carol Anne into her bedroom closet, which seems like the entrance to the other side. A family's home is haunted by a host of ghosts."

He not so much employs Barry and Dick, but rather keeps them around as they showed up at the store one day and never left. All three are vinyl and music snobs, but in different ways. Rob has a penchant for compiling top five lists. The latest of these lists is his top five break-ups, it spurred by the fact that his latest girlfriend, Laura, a lawyer, has just broken up with him. He believed that Laura would be the one who would last, partly as an expectation of where he would be at this stage in his life. Rob admits that there have been a few incidents in their relationship which in an of themselves could be grounds for her to want to break-up. To his satisfaction, Laura is not on this top five list. Rob feels a need not only to review the five relationships, which go back as far a middle school when he was twelve, and try to come to terms with why the woman, or girl as the case may be, left him, but also, in the words of Charlie Nicholson, number four on the list, ""what it all means"" for why he has ended up where he is, which is no where, personally or professionally, close to what he envisioned. He also has to come to terms with what it means that Laura has moved on to Ian Raymond, a man for who neither had any respect when they were together. High Fidelity follows the 'mid-life' crisis of Rob, a thirty-something record-store owner who must face the undeniable facts - he's growing up. In a hilarious homage to the music scene, Rob and the wacky, offbeat clerks that inhabit his store expound on the intricacies of life and song all the while trying to succeed in their adult relationships.

This catalysts a sordid self examinatory process about all his failed relationships. It's centred around his record shop, and coloured by his two motley socially inadequate assistants.

He reviews his top five worst breakups (he constantly makes top five lists, though usually about music). He recalls each breakup, reconnects with these former loves to find out why they dumped him, and wallows in misery from losing Laura. Much of it plays out at his vinyl record store where he and two clerks, socially-inept savants, live and breathe obscure contemporary music. Rob makes fruitless attempts to win Laura back, indulges in new relationships laced with fantasy, and tries introspection. What will Laura do? Rob, a record store owner and compulsive list maker, recounts his top five breakups, including the one in progress."

As a third generation member of a NASCAR family, racing is in Maggie Peyton's blood, but she is forbidden from pursuing her dream by her overprotective father, Ray Peyton, Sr. When Ray Sr. offers Maggie a car as a college graduation present, he takes her to a junkyard to choose one from an assortment of very used cars. Maggie has her eye on an old Nissan, but a certain rusty, banged up '63 VW Bug seems to be clamoring for her attention. To her surprise, Maggie leaves the lot with Herbie. As she prepares to leave town for a position with ESPN News, Maggie discovers that Herbie has a mind of his own--and an alternate route for her future. Southern Californian Maggie Peyton has car racing in her blood, with her now deceased paternal grandfather a famous and successful driver, and her father, Ray Peyton, leading his own NASCAR team. Maggie took to street racing as Ray wouldn't let her drive in legitimate races. A potentially life threatening car accident while street racing made Maggie trade in her four large wheels for four smaller ones in the form of a skateboard, and Ray sending her off to college (from where she's just graduated) to get her out of the racing life, with an imminent corporate job in New York City.

Dr. Noah Praetorius (Cary Grant) is a successful and extremely gifted gynaecologist, a popular university professor and conductor of the student symphony orchestra. He is often regarded as a genius and considers life is the only real priority.

1280,0450121.jpeg,,"The film is inspired by the true story of Mirco Mencacci, one of the most gifted Italian sound editors working today, who happens to be blind. A small village in Tuscany, 1971. Mirco is a bright, lively 10-year-old, crazy about the movies - especially Westerns and adventure films. His father, an incurable idealist, is a truck driver. One day, while Mirco is playing with an old rifle, the gun accidentally goes off; the boy is shot in the head. He survives, but loses his sight. At that time, Italian law considered blind people hopelessly handicapped, and did not permit them to attend public school. Hence, young Mirco's parents are forced to shut their son up in a ""special school for the blind"": the David Chiossone Institute in Genoa. In the beginning Mirco does not accept his new condition. But he is feisty and determined. When he finds an old tape recorder and a few used reels and discovers that by cutting and splicing tape he can create little fairy tales made only of sounds, a brand-new world opens up to him. His new adventure is opposed by the religious authorities that run the boarding school, who are convinced that a blind boy is a disabled person who must not be allowed to harbor illusions. But Mirco will not give up. He continues to fight in every way possible, and he slowly involves his classmates, leading them to rediscover their dreams and capacities. Then one night, with the help of the only sighted child - the daughter of the doorkeeper, with whom Mirco shares a tender friendship - he convinces the small group of boys to sneak out of school and go to the cinema down the street. For all of them, the experience is exhilarating. But the consequences are grim. Mirco is expelled. In the meantime, a broader struggle to change society is taking place outside. 1970's political protests are erupting. Students are taking to the streets. During one of his earlier escapades, Mirco had made friends with Ettore, a blind university student with strong political awareness. Hearing that Mirco has been expelled, Ettore pushes the whole city to mobilize. Students and workers protest in front of the Cassone Institute, threatening to shut down the city's blast furnace if Mirco is not re-admitted. As a consequence, the head of the institute is put under investigation. Mirco is finally re-admitted and granted special permission: to change the year-end show. Instead of reciting the usual religious poems, the children put on a performance of their ""fairy tale in sound"", before an audience of blind-folded, spellbound parents. A nearly sightless boy is sent to a school for blind children, where he secretly discovers the possibilities of the recorded sound."

Scott is then assigned a partner -- sharpshooter Kevin McCall. That night, Scott takes his friend, Lieutenant Sam Baffert, to see a man named Michael Korda. Scott waits downstairs while Sam is in Korda's apartment. Sam asks Korda about a man who deals in stolen jewelry, because Sam suspects that some of the dealer's jewels came from Korda, who is a professional jewel thief. Sam's visit with Korda ends with Korda killing Sam. When Scott hears a woman in the building scream at the sight of Sam's body, Scott runs inside the building and sees the body. Scott wants revenge on Korda, but Captain Frank Solis refuses to let Scott work the case, so Scott decides to work the case on his own. Scott and Kevin go to a horse race track, where they win a bundle of money, then they are called to a downtown jewelry store where hostages are being held. When Scott notices that Korda is the hostage taker, Korda grabs a hostage and leaves in a truck. Scott and Kevin use Captain Solis's car to chase Korda. Korda wrecks the truck, and leaves the hostage behind when he gets out of the truck. Korda then boards a trolley car, and Scott and Kevin start chasing the trolley car. While up close, Scott jumps onto the trolley car, leaving Kevin to drive Solis's car. Scott and Kevin manage to stop the trolley car, and they chase Korda into a parking garage, where Korda tries to hit Scott with a car. Scott and Kevin still manage to grab Korda. During visitation at the jail with his cousin Clarence Teal, Korda orders Teal to kill Ronnie as a way to get revenge on Scott. Teal shows up at Ronnie's apartment that night and attacks Ronnie. Scott shows up and chases Teal down the fire escape, and Teal is hit and killed by a car. On the next morning, Korda escapes from the jail, and soon after escaping, Korda kidnaps Ronnie, luring Scott into a confrontation at an abandoned shipyard.

When his friend and fellow police officer is assassinated by a dangerous jewel thief, he is prepared to do just about anything to bring the killer to justice. But as his quiet investigation progresses, he must also train an ultra smart SWAT sniper to become a negotiator just like him."

Pakistani police, American embassy personnel, and the FBI examine witnesses, phone records, e-mails, and hard drives. Who has him? Where is he? There's also the why: because of U.S. abuse of prisoners at Guantanamo, because of a history of Journal cooperation with the CIA, because Pearl is a Jew? Through it all, Mariane is clearheaded, direct, and determined. Daniel Pearl was born of Jewish parents. His grandfather has a street named after him in Israel (Chaim Pearl St.). He fell in love with a Cuban-American, Marianne, and got married. One the places they chose for their honeymoon was Mumbai, India. Both worked as journalists with the Wall Street Journal. They were among the thousands of reporters who headed to Afghanistan after September 11, 2001. After spending considerable time there, with Marianne visibly pregnant, they went to Pakistan, the country that on one hand was allied with the U.S. for its ""war against terrorism,"" and on the other hand was responsible for the creation of Taliban and hosting training camps for Al Qaeda. The two hook up with fellow journalist Asra Nomani of Indian descent. When Daniel goes off to interview Sheikh Gilani and does not return nor answer his cell phone, a frantic Marianne asks for assistance, which comes initially from Pakistan's CID Chief Javed Habib, then the FBI and American embassy personnel. What results is media frenzy, the locals blaming the Mosaad for the September 11 attacks, as nearly 4000 Jews did not show up for work that day; that Daniel was CIA/Mosaad Agent, and that Asra was an Indian spy. The Pakistani Interior Minister went on record to criticize Daniel for probing into unknown territory, not keeping his Jewish background secret, and blaming his disappearance on Indian spies, while the western media quickly announced his death even though the deceased was an Iranian student. Watch what happens when investigations lead to the discovery of a camcorder which may provide the last and perhaps the only clue to the whereabouts of this missing journalist.

John Hammond has invited four individuals, along with his two grandchildren, to join him at Jurassic Park. But will everything go according to plan? A park employee attempts to steal dinosaur embryos, critical security systems are shut down and it now becomes a race for survival with dinosaurs roaming freely over the island. On Isla Nublar, a new park has just been built with genetically engineered dinosaurs. Tragedy strikes when one of the workers is killed by a velociraptor. The founder of the park, John Hammond, (Richard Attenborough) requests Paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neil) and his assistant, Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) to come to the park and ensure that it is safe. Also joining them are Hammond's lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) and chaos theorist Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). When they reach the island, they are amazed to discover that Hammond has created living dinosaurs. However, at the same time they all have their doubts. Later, Hammond's grandchildren Lex and Tim (Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello) join the group in a tour of the park. Sattler leaves the tour to take care of an ill triceratops. Soon the power in the park is shut down by computer systems geek Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) who wishes to steal embryos from the park to sell to a secret buyer. In the process, many dinosaurs escape their paddocks, including the deadly Tyrannosaurus Rex, who, during a thunderstorm, escapes his paddock & attacks the children, and eats Gennaro. Malcolm is injured & Grant and the children are then lost in the park. Meanwhile, Hammond, Sattler and the rest of the operations team learn that Nedry (who in the meantime has been killed) has locked up the computer system to cover his tracks. They attempt to get power back in the park in order to escape the island. After shutting down the system, then restoring it, the group realizes that velociraptors are also on the loose, & are now on the hunt for the visitors. On the remote island of Isla Nubar, Scientists are using genetics enhanced with frog DNA, create cloned dinosaurs. While giving a preview tour, the power goes off in the rain and leaves a group of scientists and two kids to survive an island with meat eating dinosaurs. Scientists develop a means of bringing dinosaurs to life using DNA taken from dino blood, which has been preserved inside insects encased in amber. Whilst Hammond is showing off his dinosaur 'theme park' to a selected audience [a lawyer (Gerrano), mathematician (Malcolm), dino expert (Grant), paleobotanist (Sattler) and his grandchildren (Tim & Lex)], Nedry (computer expert) disables the security system so that he can make his escape with some stolen embryos. This enables all the dinosaurs to escape their enclosures... On a remote island, a wealthy entrepreneur secretly creates a theme park featuring living dinosaurs drawn from prehistoric DNA. Before opening the attraction to the public, he invites a top paleontologist, a paleobotanist, a mathematician/theorist, and his two eager grandchildren to experience the park -- and help calm anxious investors. However, their park visit is anything but tranquil as the park's security system breaks down, the prehistoric creatures break out, and the excitement builds to surprising results. During a preview tour, a theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok."

Along the way, they encounter a series of adventures that include multiple bus problems, an overnight stay at a Catholic school for boys run by Father Chase, a Western dude ranch owned by millionaire Mr. Farriday, a flamboyant movie director shooting a Western on location, and a bunch of menacing biker toughs. Mother Superior Simplicia has been head of St. Francis Academy for twenty years, she who has fairly traditional views and attitudes. Relatively new to the academy is young Sister George, a progressive nun who more closely matches the personalities of their teenaged female students than the other sisters. Sister George most closely identifies with Rosabelle, a bright but rather undisciplined girl who is always getting into trouble along with her best friend, Marvel Ann, who is the follower between the two. Mother Superior and Sister George generally do not see eye to eye on any subject, the latest being a multi-faith co-ed rally in Santa Barbara, California - 3,000 miles away - to which Sister George wants to expose the students. Much to Mother Superior's chagrin, the Bishop, wanting the academy to move into the new and ever changing world of the late 1960s, approves the trip for a select group of students and their sister chaperons. Although neither Rosabelle or Marvel Ann meet the criteria to go on the trip, they both manage to finagle their way along. Along the 3,000 mile bus ride, Mother Superior, the sisters and the students get into one misadventure after another. By the end, Mother Superior and Sister George will either be at each other's throats or will come to a better understanding of the other and what the academy needs to do to be relevant in this changing world. An old-line Mother Superior is challenged by a modern young nun when they take the girls of St. Francis Academy on a bus trip across the U.S.A."

With this fact in mind, Sergei Bounine, a former Russian general in the Tsar's army and now a Parisian restaurateur, and two of his Russian associates, Boris Chernov and Piotr Petrovin, have long hatched a plan to access that money: find a young woman to impersonate Anastasia. Bounine thinks he's found the perfect woman when another of his associates spots someone on the streets of Paris who has more than a passing resemblance to what most people probably believe Anastasia would look like.

1468,0101700.jpeg,,"The story is centered on a microcosm of a post-apocalyptic society where food is so rare it's invaluable and is used as currency. The story centers on an apartment building with a delicatessen on the ground floor. The owner of the eatery also owns the apartment building and he is in need of a new maintenance man since the original ""mysteriously"" disappeared. A former clown applies for the job and the butcher's intent is to have him work for a little while and then serve him to quirky tenants who pay the butcher in, of course, grain. The clown and butcher's daughter fall in love and she tries to foil her father's plans by contacting the ""troglodytes"", a grain eating sub-group of society who live entirely underground. The ""trogs"" are possibly the most sensible of the lot, as they see food as food and not money. Delicatessen is a story of about a small community living within an apartment building during a post-apocalyptic era. After an ex-clown named Louison, played by Dominique Pinon, reads of a handyman position available at the apartment building, he decides to move in. In this new world of famine, food is a rare commodity and people will do whatever is necessary for survival. The owner of the apartment building is also the butcher who works in the butcher shop on the first floor. It is here that the tenants are given their rations of human flesh which is paid for with corn, their primary currency. What Louison does not realize is that his position was opened because the previous handymen have been murdered and eaten, and his new employer does not intend for him to be an exception. However, the butcher's daughter grows quite fond of Louison and interferes with her father's plot to kill him by hiring an underground society to capture and extract Louison to safety. France, post-apocalypse. Food is scarce and the residents of a block of flats must exist on what they can. Operating out of the ground floor of the building, and living in one of the flats, is a butcher. He has a method for procuring meat - by hiring a handyman for the building and then killing him. Food stocks are once again running low so he hires a handyman, Louison. However, the butcher's daughter, Julie, falls for Louison and will go to any length to prevent him from getting the chop, including getting him kidnapped by some not-entirely competent terrorists/rebels. High jinks ensue. In a post-apocalyptic world, the residents of an apartment above the butcher shop receive an occasional delicacy of meat, something that is in low supply. A young man new in town falls in love with the butcher's daughter, which causes conflicts in her family, who need the young man for other business-related purposes. Post-apocalyptic surrealist black comedy about the landlord of an apartment building who occasionally prepares a delicacy for his odd tenants."

For the seventh year in a row, the Santa Rosa Jaycees are organizing the California edition of the American Junior Miss beauty pageant, this year with much of the same organizers as previous years. The thirty-odd contestants include the regular mix of confident girls, gregarious girls, shy girls, naive girls and backstabbing girls, but they all have the same goal of wanting to win and saying and doing what they believe the judges want to hear and see.

As their romance quickly blossoms, Eva befriends Marianne (Catherine Keener), her new massage client. Marianne is a beautiful poet who seems ""almost perfect"" except for one prominent quality: she rags on her ex-husband way too much. Suddenly, Eva finds herself doubting her own relationship with Albert as she learns the truth about Marianne's ex. Divorced Eva is a Los Angeles based masseuse, whose only child, teenager Ellen, is going away to college, Sarah Lawrence, in the fall, leaving Eva as an empty nester. As such, Eva slowly turns her motherly focus to Ellen's best friend, Chloe, without even realizing it. Not one for confrontation, Eva quietly accepts certain foibles of her clients without dealing with them as issues, such as Martin with halitosis, constant chatterbox Cynthia who Eva just tunes out, and young Hal who never offers to carry Eva's heavy and bulky massage table up his long and steep front set of stairs, but who she in turn never asks.

With her relationships with Marianne and Albert on firm ground, Eva learns indirectly that Albert is Marianne's ex-husband, the man who Marianne has bad-mouthed time and time again in her and Eva's private conversations. Rather than confront the coincidence head on, Eva decides to remain silent about her finding to both Marianne and Albert. The subsequent private conversations that Eva has with Marianne and Albert could taint her feelings about the other. But if Marianne and/or Albert were to find out that Eva knew the situation without telling them, it could ruin the relationships Eva so needs at this crucial time in her life.

She generally works on fluff pieces, but on occasion is allowed to do hard hitting stories which she prefers. From her apartment window one morning, she sees what she is certain is the stabbing murder of a black man by a white woman in an apartment across the way, the black man, seeing her, who tried to scrawl the word ""help"" in his own blood on the window. Reporting what she saw to the police, Grace gets little help from them, with who she has a bad relationship if only because of previous stories she has written on police brutality and racism.

1495,0093058.jpeg,,"A two-segment look at the effect of the military mindset and war itself on Vietnam era Marines. The first half follows a group of recruits in boot camp under the command of the punishing Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. The second half shows one of those recruits, Joker, covering the war as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, focusing on the Tet offensive. The lives of several young men who undergo Marine Corps basic training and are then shipped off to Vietnam. The main character is J.T. 'Joker' Davis who, along with all the other new recruits, constantly has to deal with their demanding Drill Instructor, Gny. Sgt Hartman. One recruit in particular, Leonard 'Gomer Pyle' Lawrence, is having a particularly hard time, especially after DI Hartman punishes the entire squad anytime he screws up, which is often. It all leads to tragedy. Davis makes it through and soon finds himself in Vietnam working as a combat journalist where he gets to see the horrors of war first-hand during the Tet offensive. A two-segment story that follows young men from the start of recruit training in the Marine Corps to the lethal cauldron known as Vietnam. The first segment follows Joker, Pyle and others as they progress through the hell of USMC boot-camp at the hands of the colorful, foul-mouthed Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. The second begins in Vietnam, near Hue, at the time of the Tet Offensive. Joker, along with Animal Mother, Rafterman and others, face threats such as ambush, booby traps, and Viet Cong snipers as they move through the city. Full Metal Jacket begins by following the trials and tribulations of a platoon of fresh Marine Corps recruits focusing on the relationship between Gunnery Sergeant Hartman and Privates Pyle and Joker. We see Pyle grow into an instrument of death as Hartman has foreseen of all of his recruits. Through Pyle's torment and Joker's unwillingness to stand up against it the climax of part one is achieved with all three main characters deciding their fates by their action or inaction. The second chapter delves into Joker's psyche and the repeated referral to the fact that he joined the Corps to become a killer. When his mostly behind the scenes job as a combat correspondent is interfered with by the Tet offensive he is thrust into real combat and ultimately must decide if he really is a killer. During the Vietnam War private 'Joker' -the narrator, a future author- and his class are put through the US Marine indoctrination and training under DI Gunnery Sergeant Hartman's verbally and physically abusive, sex-obsessed style. It's all far worse for fat simpleton Pyle, who keeps doing everything wrong, even when gentle Joker is appointed his personal tutor, until peer pressure becomes group bullying. On their last day at Paris Island, when everyone graduates, the psychological time-bomb explodes. Only intellectual Joker isn't assigned to jungle duty but as military war correspondent. He's unwilling to play the deceptive propaganda game and violence catches up even in the 'safe' city Hue. A pragmatic U.S. Marine observes the dehumanizing effects the Vietnam War has on his fellow recruits from their brutal boot camp training to the bloody street fighting in Hue."

The book promises its reader that he can climb the corporate ladder simply and quickly. The Worldwide Wicket Corporation, the business in the office building whose windows he washes is, according to the book, the perfect type of business. There he meets secretary Rosemary Pilkington, who sees in Ponty (as she calls him) an unassuming man who she believes the corporate world will eat alive.

Jill decides to call the police to trace the call. Jill is freaked out when she finds out that the call is coming from inside the house! Jill runs in a hurry trying to get the children and leave. Will Jill make it in the house in time? Will she live? Well you just have to watch the movie to find out! Jill Johnson, a young teenager, is asked to baby sit for a rich family in a massive 3 story house. The kids are sleeping, giving her no company until she gets a mysterious unknown call. When she finds out the caller is in the house, she fights for freedom. Can she escape and save the kids in time? A young high school student babysits for a very rich family. She begins to receive strange phone calls threatening the children. When she finally realizes that it's not a joke, she calls the police, only to find that the call is coming from inside the house. Jill Johnson is a normal teenager. She has a boyfriend, she's a freshman in high school, a runner...But when she goes over her cell phone bill by 800 minutes her parents make her pay it off by baby sitting. She's driven to the Mandrakis' house, a rich family with 2 kids who are already asleep. but when the parents leave Jill starts getting weird calls. Sometimes the caller doesn't say anything, but when the ominous voice asks ""have you checked the children?"" Jill checks on them and returns only to have the caller phone again knowing she had gone upstairs. Jill freaks out and phones the police. They say they will trace the call if she can keep him on the line for more then a minute. But what the police tell her when she succeeds will turn a routine baby-sitting gig into a 16- year-old's worst nightmare. And now she has to fight for her-and the kids'- lives in a struggle for survival. A slick remake of the 1979 original, Simon West's WHEN A STRANGER CALLS is a contemporary update of a well-known suburban legend. When 16-year-old Jill exceeds her cell phone minutes, her parents force her to spend the night babysitting instead of attending a huge bonfire bash. As Jill's father drives her to Dr. Mandrakis's house for the evening, we are given the sense from the long drive, spooky music, and winding roads, that the home seems to be at the end of the World. Perched over the edge of a steamy lake, the mansion-like structure is made entirely of dark wood and glass. With an arboretum built into its center, the palatial home feels both Zen-like and forbidding. With the children already asleep, Jill spends the first hour indulging in secret babysitter pleasures like snooping and trying on Mrs. Mandrakis's jewelry. Without a cell phone or car, and all her friends' phones out of range, Jill is particularly isolated--the perfect victim for a psychopath on the loose. As she begins to get calls from a heavy-breathing stranger, what at first seems like a prank slowly becomes a real threat, creating a panic-filled evening that's any babysitter's nightmare. Using modern-day luxuries like caller ID, security alarm systems, and motion-sensor lights to its advantage, the film plays with themes of technology and wealth, pondering how much protection they actually provide. Clearly targeted at a teenage audience, the PG-13-rated film contains relatively little violence and instead uses unfamiliar spaces and a sense of the unknown to keep audiences scared. During a babysitting gig, a high-school student is harassed by an increasingly threatening prank caller."

Pragmatic pre-teen daughter Lucy soon takes to his charm, but Paula remains determined to hate all actors. Despite the stress of a Broadway Shakespeare lead he must play too queer for Frisco, he's determined to snatch romance from ingratitude. Ex-Broadway chorus dancer Paula McFadden lives with her adolescent daughter, Lucy, and Paula's lover, actor Tony De Forrest. Paula has solely been playing ""wife"" and mother ever since she got married to Lucy's father, Bobby Kulick, which, after their divorce, was followed by her relationship with Tony. Paula comes home one day to find that Tony has left her. Not only will Paula have to start working again (as Tony was the household breadwinner), the only thing she knows being dancing, but she may have to look for another apartment. Unknown to Paula, Tony, whose name was on the apartment lease, has sublet it to Elliot Garfield, an actor from out of town who has come to New York to appear as the lead in an off off Broadway production of Richard III. Paula will not give up the apartment without a fight, but an equally tenacious Elliot figures the law is on his side and he does have a key. So pragmatic Paula figures the easiest thing to do is to share the apartment with Elliot. Paula doesn't much like Elliot, solely because of what he represents to her, and thus Paula tries to make his life as miserable as she can there in hopes that he will leave. However Elliot and Lucy get along famously. As Paula and Elliot try to co-habitate, they each have their own professional problems, Paula's being that she is woefully out of shape to be a dancer, and Elliot's being that he doesn't see eye to eye with his Richard III director, who wants to take the production in a whole different and unconventional direction. As each tries to earn a living, they find that they are falling for each other. But Paula, a two time loser in love, is hesitant to get into a relationship with Elliot, who she believes will ultimately leave her like Bobby and Tony did before."

1541,0107376.jpeg,,"The film takes the viewer on a journey west, from India to Spain, with stops along the way, to dramatize Romany's nomadic culture. This journey takes place over a year's time, from summer through fall and winter to spring. Gatlif holds his camera on the elemental essentials of this life: water, the wheel, fire, beasts of burden and of sustenance, colorful clothes, jewelry, musical instruments, song, and dance. Throughout, via song and dance, young and old celebrate, embody, and teach the cultural values of family, journey, love, separateness, and persecution. Latcho Drom (rom for ""safe journey"") describes the travels, singing and dancing of Romany groups from Rajahstan (India), Egypt, Turkey, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, France, and Spain. Some scenes are acted, but there is no dialogue or narration--only partial translation of some songs. The film illustrates the variety of conditions in which the Romany people live--earthbound nomads in the hot deserts of Asia, ironsmiths and abjectly poor tree-dwellers in the frozen plains of Eastern Europe, and craftspeople and traders in the hills and seasides of north Africa and western Europe. It also illustrates the similarities in travel habits, musical tones (spoons, open drums, and string-based rhythms) and song themes (celebration of travel and perceived rejection by sedentary locals). The journey of the Romany people told through musicians and dancers of India, Egypt, Turkey, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, France, and Spain."

1548,2340784.jpeg,,"A place: Theresienstadt. A unique place of propaganda which Adolf Eichmann called the ""model ghetto"", designed to mislead the world and Jewish people regarding its real nature, to be the last step before the gas chamber. A man: Benjamin Murmelstein, last president of the Theresienstadt Jewish Council, a fallen hero condemned to exile, who was forced to negotiate day after day from 1938 until the end of the war with Eichmann, to whose trial Murmelstein wasn't even called to testify. Even though he was without a doubt the one who knew the Nazi executioner best. More than twenty-five years after Shoah, Claude Lanzmann's new film reveals a little-known yet fundamental aspect of the Holocaust, and sheds light on the origins of the ""Final Solution"" like never before. 1975. In Rome, Claude Lanzmann filmed a series of interviews with Benjamin Murmelstein, the last President of the Jewish Council in the Theresienstadtghetto in Czechoslovakia, the only ""Elder of the Jews""* not to have been killed during the war. A rabbi in Vienna, following the annexation of Austria by Germany in 1938, Murmelstein fought bitterly with Adolf Eichmann, week after week for seven years, managing to help around 121,000 Jews leave the country, and preventing the liquidation of the ghetto. 2012. Claude Lanzmann, at 87 - without masking anything of the passage of time on men, but showing the incredible permanence of the locations involved - exhumes these interviews shot in Rome, returning to Theresienstadt, the town ""given to the Jews by Hitler"", a so-called model ghetto, but a ghetto of deceit chosen by Adolf Eichmann to dupe the world. We discover the extraordinary personality of Benjamin Murmelstein: a man blessed with a dazzling intelligence and a true courage, which, along with an unrivaled memory, makes him a wonderfully wry, sardonic and authentic storyteller. Through these three periods, from Nisko in Poland to Theresienstadt, and from Vienna to Rome, the film provides an unprecedented insight into the genesis of the Final Solution. It reveals the true face of Eichmann, and exposes without artifice the savage contradictions of the Jewish Councils. *according to Nazi terminology"

Los Angeles narcotics detective John Kimble has long been after drug kingpin Cullen Crisp, who is a psychopath.

1577,0060121.jpeg,,"Professor David Pollock is an expert in ancient Arabic hieroglyphics. A Middle Eastern Prime Minister convinces Pollock to infiltrate the organization of a man named Beshraavi, who is involved in a plot against the Prime Minister. The nature of the plot is believed to be found in a hieroglyphic code. Beshraavi's mistress, Yasmin Azir is a mystery intertwined in the plot. Pollock needs her help, but when she repeatedly seems to double cross him in one escapade after another, he can't decide on whose side she is working. Ultimately working together, Pollock and Yasmin decipher the plot and set out to stop an assassination of the Prime Minister. A man kills Professor Ragheeb and takes a hieroglyphic from his glasses. Then he seeks out the American Professor David Pollock, who is an expert in hieroglyphics at the Oxford University, and tells that his name is Major Sylvester Pennington Sloane. He invites Pollock to travel to London to meet the wealthy Nejim Beshraavi to translate a cipher in a hieroglyphic, but Pollock refuses the work. Soon Pollock is summoned by the Arabian Prime Minister Hassan Jena, who is unofficially in England and asks him to accept the assignment and spy the activities of Beshraavi that might be plotting something evil. Beshraavi offers 30,000 dollars to Pollock to work in his mansion deciphering the hieroglyphic. Pollock meets Beshraavi's mistress Yasmin Azir (Sophia Loren), who tells him that he is in danger and Beshraavi will kill him in the end of his work the same way he did with Professor Ragheeb. Pollock and Yasmin flee from the mansion with the hieroglyphic, but he is double-crossed by Yasmin and captured by Yussef Kasim. Soon the professor is deeply involved in an international conspiracy where everybody wants the cipher and he does not know who is trustworthy. Mild mannered American David Pollock, a professor of ancient hieroglyphics at Oxford, has been hired by Middle Eastern shipping magnate, Nejim Beshraavi, to decode a hieroglyphic written cipher, of which he has the original. What Beshraavi is unaware of is that David only took the job as a favor to Middle Eastern Prime Minister Hassan Jena, who David admires. David just met Jena for the first time on his clandestine visit to London prior to his official visit to sign a business treaty with the British government in two days' time. Jena tells him that what Beshraavi is asking him to do involves some plot orchestrated by Beshraavi, a countryman of Jena's, against his government. For Jena's security, David is not to disclose to anyone that he is doing this job for Jena, that he has even met Jena, or that Jena is already in London. This job also entails some personal risk to David's life as Beshraavi is not averse to killing to achieve whatever his goal. As David progresses on his task, he is approached by Yasmin Azir, the beautiful owner of the house where Beshraavi is staying and where David is doing the work, she who is Beshraavi's lover. She provides information which suggests that his task is more dangerous than it appears on the surface, as there are more players beyond Beshraavi interested in the cipher and its message, they who will also kill as needed to achieve their goal. However, David, who initially takes her information at face value, begins to have doubts if she is truly working in his best interest. Story of international intrigue involving a university professor, an Arab prime minister, a ruthless businessman, a beautiful spy, and hieroglyphics."

1584,0436864.jpeg,,"Just imagine waking up tomorrow with no memory of today or any other since the day of your birth. Imagine living without a history, without experience, no relationships, no past troubles. Imagine starting your life over again, making a new set of friends, finding new talents and falling in love for the first time. Imagine what it's like to see the world anew. On the 2nd July 2003 Doug Bruce left his apartment on the Lower East Side at about 8pm. No one knew where he was going. No one knew he'd gone. He turned up, 11 hours later, on the New York subway heading to Coney Island. He had no idea who he was. Unknown White Male is the startling story of a man who, for no apparent reason, lost 37 years of life history, who lost every memory of his friends, his family and every experience he had ever known. This true story follows Doug in the hours and months following his amnesia, as he tries to pierce his life back together and has to discover the world anew. The film dramatically reconstructs those first terrifying hours in Coney Island as Doug wandered around disoriented before asking the police for help and being sent to Coney Island Hospital Psychiatric ward where he was given an identity wrist tag reading 'Unknown White Male'. Doug had nothing to identify him and whilst he discovered after a few hours that he was able to sign his name, no one could read his signature and reveal his name. Unable to leave until someone could identify him, all attention turned to the single phone number in his possession. The woman on the other end, Eva, didn't recognize him. Finally Eva sent her daughter Nadine to investigate. Nadine recognized the man she had recently become friends with, Douglas Bruce, a good looking, English 37 year old wealthy ex-stockbroker and photography student. She took him home. The film recounts the next crazy few weeks as Doug tried to reconstruct some kind of life; re-learning the streets around his apartment, re-meeting his family, re-learning the history of the world and what it feels like to swim in the ocean. It's an overwhelming voyage of discovery as Doug discovers art, music, movies the taste of every kind of different food and much of it was filmed by Doug himself who started recording his re-entry into the world just one week after the amnesia. Doctors were unable to find any physical basis for the amnesia and over the following months we follow Doug as he returns to his photography school where his tutor believes his work has greatly improved. He falls in love with a girl he has just met and slowly re-meets old friends including director Rupert Murray who filmed their first meeting even though he has known Doug for over 15 years. Will they still like one another? Together they travel back to London for a reunion with Doug's oldest friends. One year after the amnesia and his friends in London offer him a toast to his first birthday. Everyone seems sure that Doug has changed since the amnesia. Many people prefer the new Doug, find him more sincere and reflective but others miss the old Doug's edge and cynicism. Yet for the first year and a half, Doug didn't want his memory or his old self back. He was happy with his new life, believed it was possible to live without a past and simply looked forward to his future. But in the last few months all this has begun to change as the full implications of his loss have begun to resonate in his life and Doug has started to question who he really is. The true story of Doug Bruce who woke up on Coney Island with total amnesia. This documentary follows him as he rediscovers himself and the world around him."

Meanwhile, snobbish Mrs Railton-Bell discovers that the kindly if rather doddering Major Pollock is not what he appears to be. The news is particularly shocking for her frail daughter, Sibyl, who is secretly in love with the Major. In Bournemouth, England, the Beauregard Hotel is located three minutes from the sea and managed by Pat Cooper. It is off-season and only the resident guests are lodged in the hotel. The timid Sibyl is a spinster and hysterical woman totally controlled by her arrogant and snobbish mother Mrs. Maud Railton-Bell that does not want that she works.

John and Pat's relationship is threatened with the unexpected arrival to the hotel of Ann Shankland, she and John who have a turbulent but passionate history. Ann's arrival is not by accident, she who says she wants to help John before she gets remarried, but who may have other more self-motivated reasons for coming to see John. The focus of the entire group changes when Mrs. Railton-Bell learns of a secret the Major is hiding. As Mrs. Railton-Bell tries to control the situation with the Major to her satisfaction, which includes bending the truth to suit her own needs, the others out of their own situations, especially Sibyl, may eventually come to their own conclusions on how best to deal with the Major's issue with respect to his stay at the hotel.

1616,0085334.jpeg,,"Christmas is approaching and 9 year-old Ralphie wants only one thing: a Red Ryder Range 200 Shot BB gun. When he mentions it at the dinner table, his mother's immediate reaction is that he'll put his eye out. He then decides on a perfect theme for his teacher but her reaction is like his. He fantasizes about what it would be like to be Red Ryder and catch the bad guys. When the big day arrives he gets lots of present under the tree including a lovely gift from his aunt that his mother just adores. But what about the BB gun? Adult Ralph Parker is remembering back to a Christmas season when he was nine years old living with his parents and his younger brother Randy in the northern Indiana town of Holman. Then largely known as Ralphie, he, like most kids, loved Christmas, his favorite time of the year. He often fantasized about things that he knows now would never happen, but that within a kid's mind is totally plausible. That Christmas was memorable for: his contest-obsessed father winning a prize for the first time in his life, that prize which would be the bane of Ralphie's mother's existence; his father's seemingly never-ending battle with the furnace in the house and the neighbor's pack of dogs; his mother's attempts to get Randy to eat, he at a stage when he never ate anything voluntarily; Ralphie's changing view toward the Little Orphan Annie radio program and commercial advertising; Ralphie and his friends Schwartz and Flick's changing battle with Scut Farkus and Grover Dill, their primary bullies; the triple dog dare Schwartz issued to Flick; and Ralphie's new relationship with Lifebuoy soap. But most memorable was what he wanted more than anything for Christmas: an official Red Ryder carbine action 200-shot range model air rifle, aka a BB gun. As it looked increasingly like he was not going to get this prized gift, Ralphie went about trying to manipulate and outwit those he thought would either be the decision makers or influencers of that gift, namely his parents, his teacher, Miss Shields, and the big guy at the North Pole, even if he was in the form of a less than empathetic department store version. Ralphie, a young boy growing up, dreams of owning a Red Rider BB gun. He sets out to convince the world this is the perfect gift. But along the way, he runs into opposition from his parents, his teacher, and even good ol' Santa Claus himself. It's 1940, in the northern Indiana town of Hohman. 9-year-old Ralph ""Ralphie"" Parker wants only one thing for Christmas -- an official Red Ryder carbine-action 200-shot range model BB rifle with a compass in the stock. Between his younger brother Randy and having to handle school bully Scut Farkus, Ralphie doesn't know how he'll ever survive long enough to get the BB gun for Christmas. When Ralph asks his mother for a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas, she says, ""No, you'll shoot your eye out"". When Mrs. Shields, Ralph's teacher at Harding Elementary School, assigns the class to write a theme about what they want for Christmas, Ralph sees a golden opportunity to express his desire to have a Red Ryder BB gun. Ralph gets a C+ on the theme, and Mrs. Shields has written ""You'll shoot your eye out"" on the theme. Ralph's next plan is to ask Santa Claus for a Red Ryder BB gun, and how does Santa respond? By saying ""You'll shoot your eye out, kid."" By this time, Ralph has had enough of that. When Scut Farkus and his sidekick Grover Dill start in on Ralph while he's on his way home from school that day, Ralph knocks Grover Dill to the ground, beats Scut's face bloody, and then pounds Scut's head on the snow-covered ground several times. Ralph thinks he'll never get the BB gun for Christmas now. And all of the other kids are going to be getting what they want for Christmas. But someone may have planned a surprise for Ralph. It's Christmas time and there's only one thing on Ralphie Parker's Christmas list this year: a Red Ryder Carbine Action 200-Shot, Range Model Air Rifle, but many obstacles stand in the way of his dream because every adult that he confronts keeps telling him he'll shoot his eye out. Meanwhile The Old Man just got a major award (a lamp shaped like a woman's leg), and Mom is making sure The Old Man doesn't come near her turkey, Ralphie's friend gets his tongue stuck to a flag pole, and Ralphie utters the f-word in front of his father. Christmas is drawing nearer and Ralphie visits Santa at the department store in hopes of asking him for his dream gift. Will he receive it? Let's hope so. In the 1940s, a young boy named Ralphie attempts to convince his parents, his teacher, and Santa that a Red Ryder B.B. gun really is the perfect Christmas gift."

Just when everything seems to be going his way, it is discovered he (unwittingly) attended a Communist meeting during college when pulled there by his girlfriend at the time, and thus heavy suspicion settles over him and he'll have to stand before Congress.

Besides, it's not a bad life: Luke's beautiful lover, lawyer Adele Stanton, is all over him, the town has suddenly come back to life with excitement, and he and his ""father"" rebuild a movie palace Harry used to run, the Majestic.

He awakens on a deserted beach near a small town only to discover he has amnesia and can't remember anything about his past. But that doesn't stop the town residents from remembering him as Luke Trimble, a much beloved home-town kid to whom Appleton bears an uncanny resemblance. In the weeks that follow, the townspeople ""remind"" Appleton why Luke was so well-liked, and finds himself living up to a new set of values he never possessed prior to his accident -- and liking himself the better for it.

1644,0059742.jpeg,,"In 1930's Austria, a young woman named Maria is failing miserably in her attempts to become a nun. When the Navy captain Georg Von Trapp writes to the convent asking for a governess that can handle his seven mischievous children, Maria is given the job. The Captain's wife is dead, and he is often away, and runs the household as strictly as he does the ships he sails on. The children are unhappy and resentful of the governesses that their father keeps hiring, and have managed to run each of them off one by one. When Maria arrives, she is initially met with the same hostility, but her kindness, understanding, and sense of fun soon draws them to her and brings some much-needed joy into all their lives -- including the Captain's. Eventually he and Maria find themselves falling in love, even though Georg is already engaged to a Baroness and Maria is still a postulant. The romance makes them both start questioning the decisions they have made. Their personal conflicts soon become overshadowed, however, by world events. Austria is about to come under the control of Germany, and the Captain may soon find himself drafted into the German navy and forced to fight against his own country. Maria had longed to be a nun since she was a young girl, yet when she became old enough discovered that it wasn't at all what she thought. Often in trouble and doing the wrong things, Maria is sent to the house of a retired naval captain, named Captain Von Trapp, to care for his children. Von Trapp was widowed several years before and was left to care for seven 'rowdy' children. The children have run off countless governesses. Maria soon learns that all these children need is a little love to change their attitudes. Maria teaches the children to sing, and through her, music is brought back into the hearts and home of the Von Trapp family. Unknowingly, Maria and Captain Von Trapp are falling helplessly in love, except there are two problems, the Captain is engaged, and Maria is a postulant! Baron Von Trapp, a widower, runs his home near Salzburg like the ship he once commanded. That changes when Maria arrives from the convent to be the new governess of his seven children. Their romps through the hills inspire all to sing and to find joy in the smallest things -- like raindrops on window panes. With a renewed zest for life, the baron hosts a party to introduce his new fiance. Maria knows then she does not want to be a nun. She marries the baron. The happy ever after part is threatened when Austria's new German rulers want the baron back in military service. Maria is a failure as a nun. The Mother Superior sends her off in answer to a letter from a retired naval captain for a governess for his seven children. She goes to their house and finds that she is the latest in a long line of governesses run off by the children. She teaches the children to sing and that becomes their bonding force, of course leading her to fall in love with their father and marries him. As this is happening Austria votes to be assumed by Germany on the eve of World war II. Captain Baron von Trapp is a widowed ex-naval officer with seven children who serve only to remind him of his deceased wife. The Von Trapp home is thus turned into a gloomy place of order and discipline, until the arrival of a new governess: Frauline Marie who is from a nearby Salzburg abbey. Marie shows the Von Trapp children the miracle of the Sound of Music, and teaches them how to sing. Captain von Trapp's heart opens up to feelings he had forgotten and he and Marie fall in love. Marie and Georg von Trapp are married, only to have their world brought down around them by the 1938 Anschluss of Austria, where Nazi Germany takes control of the country and demands that Captain von Trapp assume a position in the German Navy. A woman leaves an Austrian convent to become a governess to the children of a Naval officer widower."

1669,3062880.jpeg,,"In Israel there is neither civil marriage nor civil divorce. Only rabbis can legitimize a marriage or its dissolution. But this dissolution is only possible with full consent from the husband, who in the end has more power than the judges. Viviane Amsalem has been applying for divorce for three years. But her husband Elisha will not agree. His cold intransigence, Viviane's determination to fight for her freedom, and the ambiguous role of the judges shape a procedure in which tragedy vies with absurdity, and everything is brought out for judgment, apart from the initial request. Elisha and Viviane Amsalem have been married for over twenty years with only one of their four offspring still living at home. He being devoutly Jewish and she living largely secular is only one of the major differences between the two. It is because of the many differences that Viviane has long known that she no longer loves him and that they were incompatible as husband and wife. As such, she moved out three years ago to live with her sister and her family, has supported herself as a hairdresser, has remained faithful in not carrying on with any other man but has not communicated with Elisha directly, and has maintained her family duties in cooking for Elisha and their son at home, the food which she has sent to them. She has approached the rabbinical court to obtain a gett, the equivalent of a divorce. It is more a religious document in which the husband releases the wife from her marital duties, including intimate relations. Grounds for divorce could be such things as adultery or physical abuse. Incompatibility or falling out of love are not reasonable grounds. Without these grounds, the courts cannot force Elisha to oblige her request. Although the courts can invoke penalties for failure to appear - which Elisha does often in an effort to ignore the problem - they still cannot grant her request without either these previously stated grounds or his consent. When Elisha does eventually appear in court, he denies her request despite their marriage largely being in name only. Over the course of the very drawn out proceedings, the nature of Elisha and Viviane's life in all it aspects over their entire marriage is not only exposed, but so is the nature of their society and the courts where all of the power lies with the belief in God in the male dominated culture."

1710,0053793.jpeg,,"Elmer Gantry is a fast talking, hard drinking traveling salesman who always has a risqué story and a hip flask to entertain cronies and customers alike. He is immediately taken with Sister Sharon Falconer, a lay preacher whose hellfire and damnation revivalism has attracted quite a following. Gantry uses his own quick wit and knowledge of the bible to become an indispensable part of Sister Sharon's roadshow but soon finds that his past catches up with him in the form of Lulu Bains, now a prostitute. While Gantry seeks and eventually gets forgiveness from Sharon, tragedy strikes when she finally manages to get out of her revivalist tent and opens a permanent church. It's the mid 1920s. Elmer Gantry is a hard living, smooth talking traveling salesman who often uses Christian references in his sales pitches to his largely Christian clients. Along his travels, he comes across the traveling revival show of evangelist, Sister Sharon Falconer. He is immediately attracted to her and also sees her revival meetings as a way to make money. Using his sales techniques, especially on one of Sister Sharon's underlings, the naive Sister Rachel, Elmer is able to infiltrate his way into her entourage. He becomes the symbiotic antithesis to Sister Sharon: while he tells of heading toward the depths of hell for his many sins, Sister Sharon tells of being saved from that fate if repentance is forthcoming. Elmer's presence is against the wishes of Sister Sharon's manager, William Morgan, who sees through Elmer's smooth talking veneer, although William can't argue with the bottom line that Elmer brings to the meetings. Traveling along with the show is Pulitzer Prize winning columnist, Jim Lefferts, who looks at the show and Elmer with a critical eye, despite Sister Sharon, William and Elmer welcoming him as much as they can. William's business plan thus far has been for the show to set up in small towns. So it is against his wishes that Sister Sharon, who is falling for Elmer, agrees to Elmer's plan of setting up in the larger city of Zenith, where William feels the scrutiny of the cynical urban populace will hurt their brand. But it is Elmer's past, which catches up with him in Zenith, that may be his and by association Sister Sharon's downfall. Elmer Gantry, salesman, teams up with Sister Sharon Falconer, evangelist, to sell religion to America in the 1920's. They make enough money to build a temple, and Sister Sharon falls for Elmer. Elmer, is tested by temptation and almost capitulates, but is then wrongly accused by the jilted temptress. But Sharon stands by her man and truth prevails, until both are seduced by fame and blind faith over common sense, and fate deals them a crushing blow. A fast-talking traveling salesman with a charming, loquacious manner convinces a sincere evangelist that he can be an effective preacher for her cause."

But his current life isn't totally satisfying either. He believes that his recent collection of eight baby octopi will help him define that future in conducting research on their behavior.

With few job skills, she gets a job as what she calls a floozy in the local whorehouse, despite her openly headstrong demeanor not making her well suited to the work.

1753,0961108.jpeg,,"A family with an abusive father, a sensitive son, and a mother out of her depth: we see them when Michael is about 12 and when he's in his 30's, a writer of romance novels, going home for his mother and sister's college graduations. We go back and forth between the two periods: when Michael is a boy, the pressure builds until a break is threatened and there's a fight; during his trip home, there's an unexpected death, and renewed relationships between father and son, Michael and his aunt, and Michael and his aunt's young children. Michael's estranged wife joins them for the funeral. Michael Taylor is a New York based author of romance novels. The bent toward what is generally regarded as a female genre may be due to the strong relationship he has with his mother, Lisa Taylor, in large part a measure of survival against his tyrannical father, English professor Charles Taylor. The problem he's had with his father stems back as far as childhood, when he would do things purposefully to set his father off, knowing that some sort of retribution would be coming. Michael also has a strong relationship with his only slightly older aunt, Lisa's sister Jane, who lived with them one summer, the year Michael's sister, Ryne, was born. Michael and Jane's bond was also a joint front, similarly subversive, against Charles. Michael has divorced his wife Kelly, something he has told no one in the family except Jane. Michael's trip home to celebrate Lisa's graduation from college changes when Lisa is killed in a car accident, the result of a string of errors in judgment. Lisa's death adds an extra dimension to Michael's confusion about his feelings toward family as many issues will probably be buried with Lisa, the glue that held the family together, and she who kept many of the issues of the family solely to herself. Michael's latest book, an exposé of the family masquerading as fiction and meant as a means to cleanse himself from his past, is currently sitting with the publisher, although he has given Jane an advance copy of the manuscript. As Michael and Ryne pack up some of Lisa's belongings, Michael stumbles across some materials which may provide a road to reconciliation, and not only with Charles. The Taylor family is devastated by an accident that takes place on the day their matriarch is due to graduate from college -- decades after leaving to raise her children."

Each night as they slept, sweet dreams were delivered to them from sunny Frivoli, while nightmares came to them from the mysterious Murkworks. But the malevolent master of the Murk, Synonamess Botch, was not content. He wanted the Rushers to have non-stop nightmares. To do that, he would need to gain control of the Cosmic Clock. To accomplish this, he kidnaps the deliverers of the dreams, Greensleeves and the Figmen of Imagination, and then tricks Ralph, the All-Purpose Animal and his pal Mumford into stealing the mainspring from the Cosmic Clock. Realizing they've been tricked, Ralph and Mumford try to get the spring back and prevent Botch from unleashing his nightmare bombs. Along the way, they get help from their Fairy Godmother, Greensleeves' niece Flora Fauna, the junior varsity superhero Rod Rescueman, and Botch's own head nightmare writer, Scuzzbopper. Once upon a time, two oddballs who are so eager to be heroes that they do something very wrong in trying to do something right. One of the two would-be heroes is Ralph, the all-purpose animal. He's a nice guy -- a friendly, dog-like animal who wears glasses, and has the special ability to transform into any creature he wishes to be. Mum, Ralph's prankster sidekick, is a trim fellow in a black suit who speaks in special effects and loves mischief and magic and a good time. Their relationship is the opposite of human and dogs: Mum is happy-go-lucky, Ralph is a worrier. Together they are funny, lovable dupes who have recently been exiled from Frivoli, Home of Sweet Dreams. But the paunchy and raunchy Synonamess Botch, maniacal ruler of the Murkworks Nightmare Factory wants to foil Greenie's efforts and increase his own production of nightmares, to the point where the Rushers are subjected to non-stop nightmares. Botch uses his vultures - who deliver the nightmares - to kidnap the Figs and Greensleeves. Botch also cons the innocent Ralph and Mum into freezing time in Din by releasing the Magic Mainspring from the Cosmic Clock, telling them that it's the humane thing to do. The naive ""heroes"" soon find out that stopping time was a big mistake. Their Fairy Godmother twinkles in to spell it out in her Bronx accent that they have been tricked. Ralph and Mum must now find the Spring before Botch's menacing vulture minions can drop thousands and thousands of so-called ""Nightmare Bombs"" on Din, preparing for world-wide misery when Botch starts time again. And now the two wannabe heroes and their friends joins forces to stop a madman from giving everyone nightmares.

1767,0069946.jpeg,,"Dr Jake Terrell, who has been training a pair of dolphins for many years, has had a breakthrough. He has taught his dolphins to speak and understand English, although they do have a limited vocabulary. When the dolphins are stolen, he discovers they're to be used in an assassination attempt. Now he is in a race to discover who is the target, and where the dolphins are, before the attempt is carried out. Zoologist and behavioral psychologist Dr. Jake Terrell and his team, which includes his wife, Maggie Anderson Terrell, are funded by the Franklin Foundation to conduct research with dolphins, namely to learn why they do the things they do. Their primary subject is a dolphin named Alpha - Pha for short - who was born at their research facility four years ago, and who the team raised after Pha's mother died. What Harold DeMilo, Jake's primary liaison at the Foundation, is unaware of, as is the rest of the world, but what Jake eventually divulges to DeMilo when he threatens to pull funding, is that Jake and Maggie's primary work is teaching Pha how to communicate in English. DeMilo vows to keep this information confidential as the Terrells are afraid of the outside world trying to exploit Pha. This work has stalled of late, with Pha refusing to speak, they believe because he has reached his sexual maturity. As such, they introduce a female dolphin named Beta, or Bea for short, to the research. It does more than the trick as Pha not only begins to communicate in English again, but also teaches Bea. Much to Jake's chagrin, DeMilo sends an ""old friend"" named Curtis Mahoney to the facility for a tour. What Jake and the team is unaware of is that Mahoney, who is not an old friend, blackmailed DeMilo to gain access. The team learns from DeMilo that Mahoney, out of that tour, is aware of the research and is threatening to go public. The Terrells figure they have to take preemptive action. However, what is happening with Mahoney is not all it appears on the surface, and involves a plot, indeed exploiting the dolphins, for a much more nefarious reason. When the Terrells learn what is happening, they not only try to foil the plot, but also have to make the difficult decision of what to do with Pha and Bea, which in turn may risk their research."

1803,0057643.jpeg,,"The history starts with the main character (an old executioner in the Spain of early 60's) approaching retirement age. As his profession is not exactly what you could call ""popular"", he (a very gentle and nice man, caring, and proud of traditions) begins to worry about who might take his place when he retires. He has a daughter, but, unfortunately, she seems doomed to perpetual ""spinsterhood"": as soon as any prospective groom learns about her dad and her dad's ""trade"", he runs away from her, scared. A sad life... However, a new character enters: the local undertaker, a handsome and young man who has exactly the same problem... No girl wants him given his profession. So, you have the woman whom almost nobody would marry and the man whom almost nobody would marry. Obviously, they are meant for each other. But here the old executioner has something to say: He does not object to her daughter marrying the young undertaker; he seems a decent man, and all that... But there is a condition: Only if the groom agrees to take the executioner's job when he will retire, will he agree to her daughter's marriage. And, anyway, as the old executioner says to the worried young man.... ""Don't worry, they sentence people, but, in the last moment, they're going to pardon them!"". In the years where death penalty was present in Spain, professional executioners did exist; this was not a very popular profession. As the man in our history retires, his place is vacant. His son doesn't like at all becoming an executioner, but that is the only way to keep the house where he is going to live after getting married. Anyway, executions are not very common, maybe he doesn't have to kill anyone. La historia comienza con Amadeo, el personaje principal. Es un viejo verdugo de la España de principios de los 60 a punto de jubilarse. Ya que su profesión no es exactamente lo que podríamos llamar ""popular"", él, un hombre gentil, agradable, cariñoso y amante de las tradiciones, empieza a preocuparse por quién ocupará su lugar tras su jubilación. Tiene una hija, Carmen, pero ésta, por desventura, parece abocada a la soltería perpetua: tan pronto como sus pretendientes conocen el ""negocio"" de su padre, huyen de ella, despavoridos. Una triste vida, ciertamente... No obstante, aparece ahora en la historia un nuevo personaje: José Luis, el enterrador local, un apuesto joven que tiene exactamente el mismo problema que Carmen: ninguna chica se acerca a él debido a su profesión. Así, tenemos a la mujer con la que casi nadie querría casarse y al hombre con el que casi nadie querría casarse. Obviamente, están hechos el uno para el otro, y se enamoran. Cierto día ocurre ""lo que tenía que ocurrir""... y no tienen más remedio que casarse cuanto antes. Para poder mantener a la nueva familia (en la que ahora está incluido el recién jubilado suegro), José Luis deberá relevar a Amadeo en el oficio de verdugo, cosa que le pone los pelos de punta tan sólo de pensarlo. Pero no hay por qué preocuparse, ya que, como dice Amadeo, ""sentencian a la gente, pero en el último momento casi siempre les perdonan la vida...""

After an elderly and much loved local priest, Father Lambert, is shot and killed on the street in broad daylight, the police come under great pressure to find the shooter and bring him to justice.

1821,0042192.jpeg,,"Eve is waiting backstage to meet her ""idol"" aging Broadway Star, Margo Channing. It all seems innocent enough as Eve explains that she has seen Margo in EVERY performance of the current play she is in. Only Playright critic DeWitt sees through Eve's evil plan, which is to take her parts and fiance. When the fiance shows no interest, she tries for Celeste Holmes husband and playwright. But, DeWitt (George Brandt) stops her. After she accepts her award, she decides to skip the after-party and goes to her room, where we find a young woman named Phoebe, who snuck into her room and fell asleep. This is where the ""Circle of Life"" now comes to fruition as Eve is going to get played the way she did Margo. Aspiring actress Eve Harrington maneuvers her way into the lives of Broadway star Margo Channing, playwright Lloyd Richards and director Bill Sampson. This classic story of ambition and betrayal has become part of American folklore. Bette Davis claims to have based her character on the persona of film actress Talullah Bankhead. Davis' line ""Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night"" is legendary, but, in fact, all of the film's dialog sparkles with equal brilliance. The ambitious Eve Harrington gets close to the great and temperamental stage artist Margo Channing and her friends Karen Richards and her husband, the play-writer Lloyd Richards; her boyfriend and director Bill Simpson; and the producer Max Fabian. Everybody, except the cynical critic Addison DeWitt, believes that Eve is only a naive, humble and simple obsessed fan of Margo and they try to help her. However, Eve is indeed a cynical and manipulative snake that uses the lives of Margo and her friends to reach her objectives in the theater business. Stage star Margo Channing is friend to playwright Lloyd Richards and his wife Karen, in love with director Bill Samson, and the idol of Eve Harrington who becomes her secretary-aide. Eve begins to dominate: she sends Bill Margo's birthday wishes and arranges a party for him, at which point Margo explodes. Eve becomes Margo's understudy and, when Margo misses a performance, critic Addison DeWitt gives her rave reviews while making acerbic remarks about aging actresses like Margo. At Margo and Bill's engagement party Eve tries to force Karen to get her the lead in Lloyd's new play. Margo tells Lloyd she is going to retire. Eve gets the part but Addison reveals to her he knows the lies and schemes she used to get where she is. Broadway legend Margo Channing, aging but not gracefully, has everything: a successful career, close friends, a man who loves her. She also has a 'fan' named Eve Harrington, who manages to worm her way into Margo's life, in order to ""study her like a blueprint"". Eve's sweet facade is soon seen through by a number of people, most quickly by theater critic Addison deWitt, who decides to become her mentor. Eve achieves her goal of Broadway stardom, leaving a trail of unhappiness, but ultimately contentment, behind her. An ingenue insinuates herself into the company of an established but aging stage actress and her circle of theater friends."

1833,0068334.jpeg,,"Californian lawyer Bill McKay fights for the little man. His charisma and integrity get him noticed by the Democratic Party machine and he is persuaded to run for the Senate against an apparently unassailable incumbent. It's agreed he can handle it his own way, on his own terms. But once he's in the race and his prospects begin to improve, the deal starts to change. Idealistic young lawyer Bill McKay (Robert Redford), thoroughly involved with civil rights, legal aid and ecology, agrees to run for the U.S. Senate - not to win, he tells himself, but to bring vital issues before the voters. He despises political deals and compromises, but when the possibility of victory overshadows what seemed like certain defeat, his integrity begins to weaken. A fascinating and dynamic character study showing all the inner conflicts of a decent man torn between his ambition and his conscience. It tells what it costs - emotionally, morally, financially - to run for public office, and conveys all the doubts, all the self deceptions and ultimately all the cynicism of a man who knows he has sold out for something he isn't sure he really wants. Oscar-winning screenplay by Jeremy Lardner. Handsome Bill McKay is not his father's son, his father being former California Governor, John J. McKay. An idealistic civil rights lawyer, Bill believes the political process is all style over substance, and thus he can accomplish more for the people, many of those disenfranchised, in his role as lawyer than politician. For the upcoming midterm election, Bill is approached by strategist Marvin Lucas to contest the Democratic nomination for the California senate seat, the actual election against wildly popular Republican incumbent, Crocker Jarmon. Marvin is able to sell Bill, with his supportive wife Nancy at his side, on the idea as he can easily win the nomination, but has no chance of winning the actual election against Jarmon and thus he can freely speak his mind to the California electorate. Bill's biggest condition is that his father not be involved at all, Bill not wanting his father's legacy to overshadow any of his own messages. Unfortunately for Bill, McKay Sr. may influence Bill's campaign whether or not he is directly involved. What Bill did not account for is that he has to make a credible showing or else his own reputation as a human being may be in jeopardy. So as the polls continually change for the good or bad for Bill, he may buckle under the pressure to become what he didn't want to be in the first place. His entire life, including his marriage, may also be totally taken over by the campaign process until election day. Bill McKay is a candidate for the U.S. Senate from California. He has no hope of winning, so he is willing to tweak the establishment."

Annoyed by Jerry's methods of using alcohol and women to ensure contracts for his agency, Carol tries to get him thrown out of his profession. To avoid this Jerry bribes the girl who'd testify against him, by starring her in a TV commercial for a product named VIP that he's just made up. By accident these commercials are broadcasted and to keep his job, Jerry has to come up with VIP for which he enlists the help of Doctor Linus Tyler. Carol goes to see the Doctor to try and get the VIP account, but because she and Jerry have never met, she mistakes Jerry for the Doctor. Jerry then takes advantage of this situation to win her. Account executive Carol Templeton is relatively new to the world of Madison Avenue. She believes the way to get ahead in the advertising world is through inventive campaigns and hard work such as market research. That is why she is so upset that ladies' man Jerry Webster, who works for a rival agency, has snagged yet another lucrative account based on implied nepotism and providing the client with hired sexual favors, this time in form of aspiring actress Rebel Davis. To appease Rebel's aspirations, Jerry appoints her as the commercial spokesperson for a new product called Vip, and films a few television commercials starring Rebel for the new product. In reality, Vip does not exist, the commercials which are never to air. But when Pete Ramsey, the hapless agency President, airs the commercials, Jerry has to think fast. What he comes up with: since the commercials have generated such interest and demand for Vip, he will hire renowned but temperamental scientist Dr. Linus Tyler to come up with a new product which will be Vip.

Mysterious noises, persistent leaks of dark water, and strange happenings cause her imagination to run wild, sending her on a puzzling and mystifying pursuit to find out who is behind the endless mind games. As Dahlia frantically searches for the links between the riddles, the dark water seems to close around her. But one thing trumps all others in Dahlia's world: no matter what it is that's out there, she'll stop at nothing to find it. In New York City, Dahlia has just divorced from her husband and is disputing the custody of their daughter Cecilia. She has a very restricted budget, so she moves with Cecilia to an old small apartment in an island near Manhattan. She does not pay attention to a stain of water on the ceiling of the bedroom, but once living in the place, she realizes that there is a drip of dark water in the bedroom and she asks the landlord to repair the leakage. Meanwhile, Cecilia finds a red Hello Kitty bag on the terrace, and Dahlia returns it to the administrator. In school, the teacher tells Dahlia that Cecilia has an imaginary friend called Natasha. Along the days, Dahlia has severe migraines and nightmares, while disputing her daughter in the justice and having troubles in the apartment. Dahlia decides to investigate further, and she faces a tragic accident. A mother and daughter, still wounded from a bitter custody dispute, hole up in a run-down apartment building. Adding further drama to their plight, they are targeted by the ghost of former resident."

Annabelle thinks it's because he's a coward. Union spies capture The General with Annabelle on board. Johnnie must rescue both his loves. Johnnie Gray is an engineer on his train, The General, on the Western and Atlantic railroad. When war is declared between North and South he does his best to sign up with the Confederate army but is refused because he's in a designated occupation. His sweetheart Annabelle and her family don't believe him and she's ashamed, thinking he's shirking his duty. Meanwhile the Union army hatches a plan to steal the General and when it stops in Big Shanty they snatch it and head north. Annabelle Lee is a passenger on the train and Johnnie goes behind enemy lines to rescue his train and his girl. Johnnie Gray has two loves in his life: his engine and his girl, Annabelle Lee. The War Between the States begins with an attack on Fort Sumter, and Johnnie is the first in line at the recruitment office. But the enlisting officer rejects him (not telling him the reason: he is more valuable to the South as an engineer). Annabelle believes he didn't even try to enlist, and she refuses to even speak to him until he is in uniform. Time passes and Union spies hatch a plot involving Johnnie's engine, The General. Not only do they steal The General while Johnnie and the passengers are off the train having dinner, but they kidnap Annabelle who was still on board. Johnnie pursues The General in another engine, The Texas. Through various mishaps he becomes the Unionists' sole pursuer. When the Unionists discover the train chasing them has only one man aboard, the long pursuit ends, and Johnnie barely escapes with his life. Johnnie is now behind enemy lines. He wanders the forest during a rainstorm then discovers a house, which he breaks into, grabbing what food he can. It turns out the Unionists who stole The General are using the house as a base of operations. While hiding under the dinner table, Johnnie learns the details of their next plot against the Confederates. More importantly, he discovers they have Annabelle Lee, whom he had never guessed was still on The General when it was taken. Johnnie manages to escape with Annabelle and take back The General. Now the Unionists are pursuing Johnnie, but if he and Annabelle can outrace them they can warn the Confederates of the Union's latest plan. Union solders have stolen The General, a Confederate train manned by Johnnie Gray, who was unable to enlist in the Confederate army because he is needed as an engineer. The Union plans to use the train to supply its soldiers in a sneak attack against the Confederates. But now it's up to Gray and his love, Annabelle Lee, to reclaim The General, recross enemy lines, and warn the Confederates. When Union spies steal an engineer's beloved locomotive, he pursues it single-handedly and straight through enemy lines."

In 1880, newly knighted Sir Oliver Lindenbrook, a renowned scientist teaching at the University of Edinburgh, inadvertently discovers evidence pointing to Arne Saknussemm, an Icelandic scientist from a few centuries earlier, who claimed to have found a pathway from the volcanoes in Iceland to the Earth's center. Sir Oliver writes to Swedish Professor Peter Goetabaug, an expert in world volcanoes, with his findings before proceeding with an expedition to prove Saknussemm's claim, but instead of hearing back from Goetabaug, Lindenbrook learns that Goetabaug has taken the information to glorify his own name via his own expedition. Student Alec McKuen (engaged to Lindenbrook's niece) joins Sir Oliver, quickly embarking for Iceland to beat Goetabaug to the center of the Earth. They find skulduggery in Iceland, with themselves attacked and Goetabaug murdered. Apparently there's a third party involved, whom they'll later learn to be Count Saknussemm, a descendant of Arne and a scientist in his own right. By now, Sir Oliver has recruited Hans Belker, a brawny Icelandic farmer with a beloved pet duck named Gertrude, to join them, but he must also reluctantly include Carla, Professor Goetabaug's widow, who will not provide them with her husband's prized equipment otherwise. As the four with Gertrude proceed on their precarious journey - with Carla and Sir Oliver often at odds with each other - they are initially unaware of the dangerous Count Saknussemm behind them, a crafty, cold-hearted, imperious man who initially needs to rely on Lindenbrook's expertise but who will stop at nothing to beat everyone to the Earth's center, believing this project and all its associated glory rightfully belong to him as a Saknussemm.

Andrea dreams to become a journalist and faces the opportunity as a temporary professional challenge. The first assistant Emily advises Andrea about the behavior and preferences of their cruel boss, and the stylist Nigel helps Andrea to dress more adequately for the environment. Andrea changes her attitude and behavior, affecting her private life and the relationship with her boyfriend Nate, her family and friends. In the end, Andrea learns that life is made of choices. After graduating from university, Andy lands the dream job that ""a million girls would kill for"": assistant to Miranda - the chief editor of Runway, the top-selling fashion magazine in the industry. It is a job set to fast-track her career in journalism, if she can survive a year working for Miranda. From here, Andy, with no sense of fashion at all, begins a fish-out-of-water drama as she is thrown into a lifestyle full of the fast-paced, three-inch-minimum-heel-height, diet coke and coffee substance abuse. Andy works really hard to deal with Miranda's endless unimaginable demands. She even becomes trendy and classy. However, she gradually finds she is working 24/7 and soon her life with boyfriend Nate and best friend Lily is slipping away from her. Then, she realizes that she is losing what really matters. She does not want to lose herself no matter how many pairs of Monolos and Jimmy Choos she can score along the way. The story tells the professional adventure of Andrea, whose greatest dream is to become a journalist. Andrea gets a job in the fashion industry through Runway magazine, the most famous of its type, to make ends meet. But Andrea won't develop her writing skills in the magazine, but her talents as the editor in chief's assistant, Miranda. The problem is that Miranda is a merciless, posh and cruel woman, making the experience a living hell for the girl. The environment in the place will be cold and extremely critical with the physical appearance. The girl will have to change her simple and plain style, for a more trendy and elegant one, in order to gain the acceptance of her ruthless boss and colleagues, specially Emily, her unpleasant workmate. Despite everything against Andrea in the office, she will consider the experience as a challenge, drastically changing her clothes and self-image, with the help of Nigel, the magazine's art director. Nevertheless, the job becomes extremely demanding, because of Miranda's tough work rhythm and nearly impossible tasks, leaving Andrea without a private life with her boyfriend, family and friends.

1892,1041829.jpeg,,"For three years, Andrew Paxton has slaved as the assistant to Margaret Tate, hard-driving editor at a New York publisher. When Margaret, a Canadian, faces deportation for an expired visa, she hatches a scheme to marry Andrew - he agrees if she'll promise a promotion. A skeptical INS agent vows to test the couple about each other the next Monday. Andrew had plans to fly home that weekend for his grandma's 90th, so Margaret goes with him - to Sitka, Alaska - where mom, dad, and grams await. Family dynamics take over: tensions between dad and Andrew, an ex-girlfriend, Andrew's dislike of Margaret, and her past color the next few days, with the INS ready to charge Andrew with fraud. In New York, Margaret Tate is a successful self-made chief-editor of the Ruick & Hunt Publishing and loathed by her coworkers. Margaret lost her parents when she was sixteen and is tough with the employees of the office. Her executive assistant and aspirant editor Andrew Paxton has been working with her for three years without any recognition. When Margaret has problems with the immigration due to an expired visa and is threatened with deportation, she blackmails Andrew to agree to marry her. In return, he would be promoted to editor and she would publish his book. Meanwhile, the skeptical clerk of the immigration department Mr. Gilbertson schedules an interview with Margaret and Andrew after the weekend. The couple travels to Sitka, Alaska, to celebrate the ninetieth birthday of Andrew's grandmother and Margaret is welcomed by his warming family. Over the weekend, she grows closer to Andrew's family who ask her to marry Andrew in their barn, a family tradition in the Paxton family. And the tension increases when Mr. Gilbertson appears out of the blue in Sitka promising to charge Andrew for fraud. Margaret Tate is the professionally well-respected but personally loathed senior editor at a prestigious New York publishing house. That personal loathing extends to her staff, who call her a witch behind her back, and to her life away from the office, she who is all alone in the world. Andrew Paxton, her efficient executive assistant, has put up with working for her for three years despite too loathing her solely in his career path to become an editor in his own right. A Canadian, Margaret learns that she is being deported back to Canada on expiration of her work visa. To avoid that deportation, she, with Andrew in attendance, tells, on a spur of the moment thought to company Board Chair Bergen, that she and Andrew are engaged and about to get married. In private with Margaret, Andrew agrees to her proposal on the guarantee that he immediately gets promoted to editor and that his own manuscript, which he long ago gave to Margaret to read, be published. Andrew holds to the agreement even after Margaret's case comes to the attention of Mr. Gilbertson at the Immigration Bureau, who threatens Andrew with prosecution for fraud if their imminent marriage is solely one of convenience. In preparation for their next immigration meeting, Andrew and Margaret will have the weekend truly to get to know each other as they head to Andrew's ""Gammy Annie""'s ninetieth birthday party in Andrew's hometown of... Sitka, Alaska. There, Andrew may have an upper hand in his new relationship with Margaret as they feel she has more at stake in their arrangement, and as Margaret is a fish out of water in Alaska. But other issues that come into play are: Andrew's loving family, especially Gammy Annie and Andrew's mother, Grace, welcoming Margaret despite Andrew's previous rants about what a horrible person she is; Andrew's strained relationship with his wealthy father, Joe, over Joe not understanding why Andrew doesn't want to take over the family businesses in Sitka; and Andrew being reunited with his high school and college girlfriend, Gertrude, who he once asked to marry him. Over the course of the weekend under these circumstances, both Margaret and Andrew may come to a realization of what they really want in life. A pushy boss (Sandra Bullock) forces her young assistant (Ryan Reynolds) to marry her in order to keep her Visa status in the U.S. and avoid deportation to Canada."

He is gifted with the ability to become his aggressor and think like his aggressor thus giving him the key to the aggressor as he learns to love them through their frailty - using this to exploit them and thus destroy them. This ability is seen by those old men solidified in their ways, who have no flexibility in their thinking anymore, and exploit Ender to achieve their own ends. But at what cost, and to whom?

Once there, he's trained by Mazer Rackham himself to lead his fellow soldiers into an epic battle that will determine the future of Earth and save the human race. Young Ender Wiggin is recruited by the International Military to lead the fight against the Formics, a genocidal alien race which nearly annihilated the human race in a previous invasion."

1900,0044079.jpeg,,"Bruno Anthony thinks he has the perfect plot to rid himself of his hated father and when he meets tennis player Guy Haines on a train, he thinks he's found the partner he needs to pull it off. His plan is relatively simple. Two strangers each agree to kill someone the other person wants disposed of. For example, Guy could kill his father and he could get rid of Guy's wife Miriam, freeing him to marry Anne Morton, the beautiful daughter of a U.S. Senator. Guy dismisses it all out of hand but Bruno goes ahead with his half of the 'bargain' and disposes of Miriam. When Guy balks, Bruno makes it quite clear that he will plant evidence to implicate Guy in her murder if he doesn't get rid of his father. Guy had also made some unfortunate statements about Miriam after she had refused him a divorce. It all leads the police to believe Guy is responsible for the murder, forcing him to deal with Bruno's mad ravings. Guy Haines is a well known amateur tennis player who wants to go into politics in his post tennis life. He is equally well known in the society papers as a man who wants to divorce his shrewish and cheating wife, Miriam, so that he can marry Anne Morton, the refined daughter of a state senator. To spite Guy, Miriam refuses to divorce him, while she plans to continue cavorting with other men. Bruno Antony is a charming and gregarious man, who lives off the wealth of his father. He's also a sociopath who loves his mentally childlike mother, but detests his father, who he believes is the repressive cause of his problems. Guy and Bruno meet each other one day on a train. Their social chit-chat, directed by Bruno, leads to discussion of what Bruno considers the perfect murders: each of two strangers kill the other's ""problem"" person, as each killer would have no ties to the person murdered. In their case, Bruno would kill Miriam, while Guy would kill Bruno's father. As Guy and Bruno part company, Guy believes Bruno's talk was just social chit-chat all in fun. However, Bruno believes they have a pact as witnessed by the fact that he does end up killing Miriam. Guy knows Bruno killed her, but doesn't feel he can go to the police with the fantastical story, which be thinks will implicate himself more. The situation gets worse for Guy as Bruno starts implicating himself in Guy's life to pressure Guy into keeping to his supposed end of the bargain. Guy has to figure out what to do so as not to implicate himself, not kill anyone and keep those around him safe, which may be a problem for Anne's sister Barbara who has a physical resemblance to Miriam. The other problem for Guy in going to the police is that Bruno has his personalized cigarette lighter, which he may use to implicate Guy if Guy doesn't comply. Psychotic mother's boy Bruno Anthony meets famous tennis player Guy Haines on a train. Guy wants to move into a career in politics and has been dating a senator's daughter (Ann Morton) while awaiting a divorce from his wife. Bruno wants to kill his father but knows he will be caught because he has a motive. Bruno dreams up a crazy scheme in which he and Guy exchange murders. Guy takes this as a joke, but Bruno is serious and takes things into his own hands. Tennis star Guy Haines meets a stranger on the Washington-to-New York train who offers to exchange murders. The stranger, Bruno Anthony, will kill Guy's estranged wife if Guy will kill Bruno's hated father. Guy doesn't take Bruno seriously until his wife, Miriam, is found murdered in an amusement park. Guy becomes the chief suspect, which threatens his tennis career; his romantic involvement with a U.S. senator's daughter, Anne Morton; his hopes for a political career; and even his life. When it becomes evident to Bruno that Guy isn't going to kill his father, he tells Guy that he intends to establish Guy's guilt conclusively by planting his monogrammed cigarette lighter on the island where Miriam was murdered. With Anne's help, Guy attempts to stop Bruno after rushing through an important tennis match and racing to the amusement park. A psychotic socialite confronts a pro tennis star with a theory on how two complete strangers can get away with murder - a theory that he plans to implement."

As Tony is thinking bigger than Johnny and is not afraid of anyone or anything, Tony increasingly makes decisions on his own instead of following Johnny's orders, especially in not treading on the north side run by an Irish gang led by a man named O'Hara, of whom Johnny is afraid. Tony's murder spree increases, he taking out anyone who stands in his and Johnny's way of absolute control on the south side, and in Tony's view absolute control of the entire city.

Cesca ultimately comes to the realization that she is a lot more similar to her brother than she first imagined. The prohibition of alcohol has led to a flourishing market of illegal liquors, dominated by organized crime. In Chicago the gangs control different parts of the city. As long as each gang limits its activities to its own district, there is peace between them. This balance of power is shattered, when the bodyguard Tony Camonte kills his boss Louis Costillo, and joins another gang. Tony helps his new boss, Johnny Lovo, to expand his market share by going into districts controlled by other gangs, kill their leaders and force pubs to buy illegal beer from Lovo instead. The situation quickly develops into an all-out war between the gangs. Tony wants to be the boss of the whole city. He starts disobeying Lovo, takes over his mistress Poppy, and finally kills Lovo. Tony is now the king, but he has one weak point: his overprotection of his 18-year-old sister Cesca. He forbids her to go out, and to flirt with men.

In those situations he loses his watchfulness, makes mistakes, and is vulnerable for attacks from other gangs and the police. Tony Camonte is a violent and ambitious gangster determined to rise in the Chicago underworld. After Tony kills his boss Big Louie on behalf of South Side mobster Johnny Lovo, he's promoted to being number 2 under Lovo. He warns Tony to stay from North Side boss O'Hara however. Tony is very protective of his family, especially his sister Cesca. Tony is none too subtle about getting rid of the opposition and after he takes a liking to Lovo's girlfriend, takes her as well. He eventually pushes Lovo out and takes on the North side mob. It's the beginning of the end however when he finds best friend Guino Rinaldo with his sister in her apartment. Big Louis Costillo, last of the old-style gang leaders is slain, and his former bodyguard Tony Camonte is taken into custody. Since Costillo's body has never been found, the police have to release him, though they strongly suspect Johnny Lovo paid Tony to remove Big Louis. Tony begins taking over the rackets in town with violent enforcement, and he becomes a threat to Johnny and the other bosses unless they work for Tony. Meanwhile, Tony's sister wants to be more independent, but finds it difficult to escape from her brother's overprotective grasp. The dissatisfaction of the other bosses and the relentless pursuit of the police push Tony towards a major confrontation.

Later, after John escapes from the detention center, a top secret Air Force Stealth Bomber known as the X-77, which uses the latest in stealth cloaking technology, making it capable of going anywhere undetected, is stolen by corrupt Air Force pilot Ratcher. General Tom Barnes, John's former commander, hears that John has been arrested after taking down a group of men who were robbing a rest stop. Knowing that John was Ratcher's trainer, Barnes sends John to northern Afghanistan with fellow pilot Rick Jannick to recover the X-77, promising John that he will be a free man if he succeeds. Barnes has Admiral Frank Pendleton, who is on an aircraft carrier in the Gulf of Arabia, keep a team of pilots on standby just in case an air attack needs to be launched on the compound where the X-77 has been hidden. Before John and Jannick arrive in Afghanistan, a Navy SEAL team that was planted there to meet them is killed by a group of men led by Eliana Reed.

Later, in a village close to Stone's compound, John meets up with his contacts Jessica and Rojar. Jessica tells John that the SEAL team was killed. As it turns out, Stone was born from a Muslim mother and a British father. Stone had spent his childhood in the Middle East, but was educated at Oxford.

Three years ago, Stone negotiated his way into a major arms deal, which was brokered by Eliana.

Peter Soffel is the warden at Allegheny County Prison in Pittsburgh. He is rather an emotionless man, which affects his relationship with his wife of eighteen years, Kate Soffel, the two who have a cordial but somewhat emotionally distant marriage. They live with their four children on the prison property. Despite there being a chaplain on prison staff, Kate provides Christian spiritual guidance to the inmates.

Although the brothers are admitted robbers, there is some question within the public mindset if they did commit the murder in question. They have their legion of fans, primarily young women, who are attracted to their charisma and particularly Ed's good looks. Kate and Ed get into philosophical discussions of Christ and redemption, specifically in his and Jack's situation, which leads to them getting to know each other.

That was the easy bit !!! They then had to get him back to Cairo, dodging an intense air and land search. 1944 on Nazi-occupied Crete. The Nazis truly believe that the Cretans are indeed cretins. As such, many of the Cretans work alongside some of the few native English for the resistance against their Nazi oppressors. One of those English is Major Patrick Fermor. Along with Captain W. Stanley Moss, who he recruits from the British forces stationed in Cairo, Paddy's latest mission is to kidnap Major General Kreipe, the head of the Nazi forces on the island, and transport him alive to the Allied base in Cairo. The move is solely one to embarrass and thus demoralize the Nazis by having the ""inferior"" Cretans pull off something this big over the Nazis. Kidnapping Kreipe, keeping him safe during the transport to the coast, and getting him onto the ship in the open coastline without being detected by the Nazis all have their challenges. On Paddy and Moss' side is that they have the cooperation of most Cretans who, despite possible harm to themselves, largely help them in this mission, and that as such they have a better understanding of the nooks and crannies to hide Kreipe than the Nazis, especially in the mountains. Among the obstacles they face are: having sporadic contact with their primary communications officer, Sandy, who is holed up in a cave in the mountains; Kreipe perhaps finding a weak spot in their armor, especially in playing off even one poor Cretan who may fall prey to the possibility of a bigger individual payoff; and a deficiency unearthed in both Paddy and Moss' military training. Led by British officers, partisans on Crete plan to kidnap the island's German commander and smuggle him to Cairo to embarrass the occupiers."

1971,0082416.jpeg,,"A film is being made of a story, set in 19th century England, about Charles, a biologist who's engaged to be married, but who falls in love with outcast Sarah, whose melancholy makes her leave him after a short, but passionate affair. Anna and Mike, who play the characters of Sarah and Charles, go, during the shooting of the film, through a relationship that runs parallel to that of their characters. John Fowles' original novel The French Lieutenant's Woman was distinguished by a literary technique that involved telling a story of Victorian sexual and social oppression within the bounds of a 1970s viewpoint. How does one convey this time-frame dichotomy on film? The decision made by director Karel Reisz and Harold Pinter was to frame Fowles' basic plot within a ""modern"" context of their own making. While we watch as Sarah (Meryl Streep), a 19th-century Englishwoman ruined by an affair with a French lieutenant, enters into another disastrous relationship with principled young Charles (Jeremy Irons), we are constantly made aware that what we're seeing is only a film. This is done by surrounding the story with a modern narrative, focusing on a movie production company which is on location--filming The French Lieutenant's Woman. Meryl Streep doubles in the role of Sara and the American actress who plays her, while Jeremy Irons essays the dual role of Charles and the handsome Briton playing Charles. Likewise, everyone else in the cast is seen as ""themselves"" and as their French Lieutenant's Woman characters. Not surprisingly, the ""real"" Streep and Irons enter into an affair which closely parallels their characters' relationship. The commercial TV version of French Lieutenant's Woman eliminates 30 minutes' worth of ""extraneous"" scenes. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi"

Having nothing better to do, Kale occupies himself by spying on his neighbors. But one night, he witnesses what appears to be a murder going on in Mr. Turner's house. Kale becomes obsessed with uncovering the truth behind these murders but, after a few unsettling run-ins with Mr. Turner, it becomes a matter of life and death. And the ominous question: Who is watching whom? It's been one year since seventeen year old Kale Brecht's father, Daniel Brecht, died, and Kale isn't coping well since he largely blames himself for the death. An incident associated with that inability to cope leads to Kale being sentenced to three-months house arrest for assault, he adorned with an ankle monitoring bracelet to ensure he does not step off his mother, Julie Brecht's, property. Bored, especially as his mother cuts off many of his privileges, Kale largely spends his time spying on his neighbors, most specifically his new classmate, the pretty Ashley Carlson, whose family just moved in next door. Ashley, who ends up introducing herself to Kale in her own boredom in needing to get away from her parents, and Kale's best friend, Ronnie Chu, join Kale in watching the goings-on of their neighbors. At first, they somewhat jokingly muse that one of the neighbors, seemingly fastidious Robert Turner, may be the culprit responsible for the recent disappearance of a woman in Austin, Texas based on a circumstantial piece of evidence they see. But the more and more they watch, the more and more Mr. Turner's activities seem to be suspicious in actually being able to commit violent crimes against women. Just when Kale believes he has the first solid piece of evidence - enough at least to delve into it further - Mr. Turner enters their lives in a more personal manner. For Kale, this becomes a dangerous game of cat and mouse with Mr. Turner, he believing that Mr. Turner not only is killing women, but that he knows they have been spying on him. To some extent, Ashley and Ronnie are willing participants in the game, understanding the dangers, but Kale's mom also becomes unwittingly embroiled in the danger, that danger especially if Mr. Turner is indeed what Kale thinks he is. Through it all, Kale is placed in the disadvantage that it is his word against Mr. Turner's - he convicted of a violent offense - and that he is confined to his mom's property, more than ten seconds outside the perimeter which alerts the police. After his father's death, Kale Brecht becomes sullen, withdrawn, and troubled -- so much so that he finds himself under a court-ordered sentence of house arrest after a run in with the law. His mother, Julie, works night and day to support herself and her son, only to be met with indifference and lethargy. The walls of his house begin to close in on Kale. He becomes a voyeur as his interests turn outside the windows of his suburban home towards those of his neighbors, one of which Kale begins to suspect is a serial killer. But, are his suspicions merely the product of cabin fever and his overactive imagination? After the death of his father in a car accident, Kale Brecht becomes a troublemaker and aggressive teenager. When he punches his Spanish teacher at school, he is sentenced to three months of house-arrest during his vacations. Kale snoops his neighbors with a binoculars and video camera for killing time, and becomes a voyeur of his next door neighbor Ashley Carlson. When Ashley sees Kale and his friend Ronnie at the window, he tells out of the blue that their neighbor Robert Turner seems to be a wanted serial killer from Austin, Texas. The trio sneaks around his house, and Kale begins to suspect that Mr. Turner might really be the murderer. Kale Brecht is a 17-year-old who is placed under house arrest after punching one of his teachers. He is confined to his house with no available entertainment, and decides to use his free time spying on his neighbors. Things start to get weird when guests enter Robert Turner's house and not come back out. Kale and his friends, Ronnie and Ashley Carlson, start to grow more and more interested in what is actually happening within the house of Robert Turner.

The only people who regularly see her are her hard-as-nails but seemingly loyal housekeeper Velma Crowther, and her longtime friend and physician, Dr. Drew Bayliss. She has lived there the better part of her life except for a short stint in London thirty-seven years ago following the vicious murder of her married lover, John Mayhew, at the plantation's summer house while Sam was hosting one of his legendary grand balls in the mansion. That evening, she and John were going to run off together, that is before he was bludgeoned to death, his right hand and head which were never found. No one was ever convicted for his murder, but most people believe Charlotte did it after John changed his mind about running off with her. Not having seen her in years, they also now believe Charlotte is a crazy old woman, her mental state which turned at or before the murder. Conversely, Charlotte has hidden away as she fears people would always be glaring at her. She also believes any bad thing that has happened to her following John's murder has been initiated by John's widow, Jewel Mayhew, who Charlotte blames for orchestrating the expropriation of her property to build a bridge across the lake. Charlotte is surprised that her younger cousin, Miriam Deering, who left the area years ago never to have returned and who was once Drew's romantic interest, has accepted her invitation to stay at the mansion.

Or is someone or some people trying to drive her crazy if she is not so already? If the latter, the truth behind who killed John and why may finally come to light to those who matter. Charlotte Hollis, an aging recluse deluded into a state of dementia by horrible memories and hallucinations, lives in a secluded house where, thirty-seven years before, John Mayhew her married lover, was beheaded and mutilated by an unknown assailant. Charlotte Hollis, wealthy southern spinster, is shunned by her community for the grisly murder some 40 years prior of her intended, John Mayhew. Even though her guilt in the matter was never proven, the townspeople liken her to a modern-day Lizzie Borden. The murders are similar in nature and the children even taunt her with cruel rhymes. For this reason she lives a life secluded from the mainstream of society. Her needs are cared for by her faithful servant, Velma. Now, progress in the guise of new highway construction threatens the Hollis plantation, her home and the family domicile since Civil War times.

Hobbes thought his nightmare with this killer is finally over. However, he soon discovers that there was a murder in a style very similar to Edgar Reese. Then, he found out that it was an evil fallen angel named Azazel, who can exist by possessing other people's bodies. As Hobbes tries to find out the mystery of Azazel, he also has to find a way to do the impossible, stop a fallen angel. Detective John Hobbes attends the execution of a serial killer he arrested, Edgar Reese. They have a private chat where Reese gives him a riddle of sorts and then speaks in a strange language. The riddle leads him to a once decorated policeman who one day went to his cottage in the woods and killed himself. It was never explained why but when Hobbes looks around the now decrepit cottage he finds that the man had scribbled the name Azazel on the wall. Hobbes soon learns that Azazel is an evil spirit who can transfer itself from one person to another through touch. As Hobbes comes to realize the extent Azazel is responsible for much of the evil around him he also realizes that Azazel is after him. John Hobbes watches Edgar Reese, a convicted murderer Hobbes brought to justice, get executed. Reese dies with great bravado, and then a series of murders are committed using Reese's methods. As Hobbes follows up the last clues Reese left, we see an evil presence move from person to person by touch. Hobbes comes closer and closer to the secret as the presence taunts him more and more openly, threatening everyone Hobbes holds dear in the world. Homicide detective John Hobbes witnesses the execution of serial killer Edgar Reese. Soon after the execution the killings start again, and they are very similar to Reese's style."

Although most passengers manage to survive the incident, Ellen presumably perishes when swept off her lifeboat, her body never recovered. Fast forward five years. Nicky, wanting to move on with his life, has Ellen declared legally dead. Part of that moving on includes getting remarried, this time to a young woman named Bianca Steele, who, for their honeymoon, he plans to take to the same Monterrey resort where he and Ellen spent their honeymoon. On that very same day, Ellen is dropped off in Los Angeles by the Navy, who rescued her from the South Pacific island where she was stranded for the past five years. She asks the Navy not to publicize her rescue nor notify Nicky as she wants to do so herself. Upon arrival back home, a shocked Grace Arden (Nicky's mother) informs Ellen that Nicky just got remarried that morning and that Ellen, his true wife (as opposed to Bianca, his new bride), should go to Monterrey to tell Nicky she's alive. She does, and Nicky is equally as shocked as his mother at seeing Ellen alive, but it places him in a difficult position. Although he loves Ellen and wants more than anything to be with her, he has Bianca's feelings to take into consideration. As such, he finds it difficult to tell Bianca, who is in a honeymoon amorous mood. Nicky's inability to tell Bianca irks Ellen, who believes it is a manifestation of his love for Bianca over her. Nicky, however, ends up with questions of his own about Ellen's faithfulness and love for him when he learns that Ellen was not all alone on that island but stranded with a handsome man named Stephen Burkett (with whom the two nicknamed each other Adam and Eve). Nicky's questions about her faithfulness increase when she purposefully withholds information about Stephen from him. Five years to the day after his wife Ellen disappeared in the sea after a plane crash, lawyer husband Nicholas has her declared legally dead, remarries and sets off to Monterey with new wife Bianca. The same morning, Ellen arrives home after being rescued by the Navy from a desert island and follows to try and prevent the honeymoon developing further. Nick, still in love with Ellen, is delighted to see her but finds he still can't break the news to Bianca, while Ellen equally hasn't got round to telling the children she is their mother. Could get complicated. After five years lost at sea, a missing wife thought long dead returns just after her husband remarries."

In the wake of JFK's assassination, under the shadow of the Vietnam war, an independent presidential candidate is running, bold and cheap, under the banner of the Replacement Party: their unbelievable platform includes banning lawyers from Congress and re-writing the national anthem.

2159,0457572.jpeg,,"In an Earthly world resembling the 1950s, a cloud of space radiation has shrouded the planet, resulting in the dead becoming zombies that desire live human flesh. A company called Zomcon has been able to control the zombie population. Zombies can be temporarily neutralized by being shot, but can only be permanently neutralized by their brain being destroyed. Their ultimate disposal is through cremation, or burial, the latter which requires decapitation with the head being buried separately from the body. Conversely, Zomcon has created the domestication collar, when activated and placed on a zombie makes the zombie controllable and thus an eternally productive creature within society. Because all dead initially become zombies, the elderly are viewed negatively and suspectly. And all people, adult or child, learn to shoot to kill to protect society. Zomcon is the go to organization for all things zombie. In the town of Willard, the Robinsons - father Bill, mother Helen, and adolescent son Timmy - are one family who don't own a zombie as a domestic since Bill is afraid of zombies, as, when he was a child, he had to shoot his own zombie father, who tried to eat him. Bill has thus become fascinated with funerals to see zombies put away permanently. But Helen feels pressured to get a zombie when Zomcon's new head of security in Willard, the officious Jonathan Bottoms, moves into the neighborhood with his family. Never having had to deal with a zombie directly, Timmy is initially wary of their zombie. But as a lonely child who has no friends and is often bullied, Timmy eventually befriends their zombie, who he names Fido, as he treats the zombie much like a faithful pet dog. Timmy protects Fido at all cost, even after Fido, due to no fault of its own, is implicated in some deaths, which creates a mini-wave of loose zombies unknown to Zomcon. But Fido may play a larger role within the family as a companion for Helen, who is largely neglected by Bill, since he sees human affection as ultimately resulting in such difficult issues as what happened between him and his own father. With Timmy and Helen treating Fido with kindness, Fido, in turn, may prove that not all zombies, even when without their domestication collar, are out to kill anyone and everyone in their path. Timmy Robinson's best friend in the whole wide world is a six-foot tall rotting zombie named Fido. But when FIDO eats the next-door neighbor, Mom and Dad hit the roof, and Timmy has to go to the ends of the earth to keep Fido a part of the family. A boy-and-his-dog movie for grown ups, ""FIDO"" will rip your heart out."

He's excited to show them around and dispel many of their negative stereotypes about Sicilians. He even dispels stereotypes about the mafia, saying that being a mafioso as a teen amounted to just being a messenger boy. But as Antonio reconnects with his past in Sicily, he finds out that there are more sides to being a Sicilian than he remembers. Antonio Badalamenti, a good-natured supervisor at the Fiat plant in Milan, is a native Sicilian who has lived in the North for a decade with his blonde wife and two beautiful daughters. Before leaving on a two week vacation back to his ancestral hometown, one of the plant managers tasks him to personally convey a mysterious gift to Don Vincenzo, the local godfather. Even though Nino's wife has misgivings about leaving the comforts of her comparatively luxurious life, she is unprepared for what she encounters. Marta undergoes culture shock when confronted by the poverty and comparatively crude customs of the provincial Sicilians, especially the Baladamenti family, who in turn view the refined blonde Northerner as a snobbish interloper. Bringing his family with him to pay respects to Don Vincenzo, the always obedient and affable Nino discovers the gift to be a beautifully jeweled heart pendant enigmatically inscribed with the names of of 9 deceased ""friends"" of the Mafioso. After the godfather's nephew Don Liborio reminds Nino of an oath of loyalty he took as an 18 year-old decades before, he becomes further indebted when the Don settles a controversial land transaction in favor of Nino's father. Feeling he has no choice, Nino agrees to honor his fealty by fulfilling a favor to the Don, a nightmarish favor which shakes Nino's safe, complacent world to its very core. When a good-natured factory supervisor living in Milan with his Northern wife returns to his native Sicily, a decades' old oath forces him to fulfill a nightmarish obligation."

Few think she can win, even her closest friends and relatives (e.g. slightly mad cousin Delmount) think she's heading for a big disappointment, but Carnelle is ever hopeful, seeing a win as a ticket to escape her small town in Mississippi. Carnelle Scott has lived in the same house since she moved to Yazoo City, Mississippi, following the death of her parents when she was a child. She moved in with her aunt and uncle, and grew up with her two older cousins, Elain and Delmount Williams. Carnelle has always wanted validation, which she has not yet achieved as she has no real friends, and people in the town sneer at her behind her back. The adoration of Mac Sam, her carnival roadie boyfriend, is not enough. That is why she's entered the local Miss Firecracker beauty pageant, which Elain won several years ago. This being the last year she is eligible, Carnelle even delayed entering for five years so that she could perfect her talent. As one of the strongest memories of her childhood, Carnelle wants to wear the same bright red evening gown Elain wore when she won. She's even dyed her hair bright red to match the dress. Elain, who has always seemed to have a dream life including marriage to well off Franklin Rutledge, is coming from Atlanta for this year's pageant to be a guest speaker. Elain's perfect life is showing some cracks as she is about to leave Franklin. Also returning to Yazoo City is anti-social and hot tempered Delmount, who has just been released from a mental institution, where he was incarcerated as Elain and Franklin would not take him in. Delmount owns the house and wants to sell, the proceeds which he will split with Carnelle so that they can both individually do whatever they really want to do with their lives away from Yazoo City. Along the way, Carnelle receives the support of shy seamstress Popeye Jackson, who helps her with all her pageant attire. By the end of the process, Carnelle may find that there are more important things in life than what she is initially looking for, and that perfection on the surface does not necessarily equate to happiness."

2285,0303668.jpeg,,"It is 90 AD, and the Roman Empire is being run by the Emperor Domitian, who has declared himself to be God and ruler over heaven and earth. The Christians, who do not recognize his divinity, are a thorn in his side # and he is having them cruelly persecuted. The small village in Asia Minor to which the aged apostle John has withdrawn is also attacked by Roman soldiers. As if by a miracle, John is the only person to escape the slaughter # and he receives divine orders to write down the visions he will have and communicate them to the Christian communities in the Roman provinces of Asia. The voice tells him that they should discover what is and what will happen thereafter. Among the Christians of Asia Minor, who believe that John is dead, everyone is deeply worried about being persecuted. Gaius, the community elder in Smyrna, is concerned that only a few believers still dare come to the ritual supper. Under these circumstances, Christianity can no longer exist! But at this point the young Irene appears at the secret meeting. She is convinced that John, who could give the Christians back their courage, is still alive, because a certain Theophilus, who is being held captive by the Romans on the island of Patmos, is in contact with him and had a letter sent to her. In it, John describes his vision of Heaven: And behold, a throne was set in Heaven, and one sat on the throne...and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne... and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind. And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle. ... And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book... that was sealed with seven seals. Neither Gaius nor the other adult believers understand what John means by this. Only a little child among them, also named John, grasps the sense of it: John realizes that the throne belongs to God, and sees the seven lamps of fire as the seven Christian communities of Asia Minor, together with the four elements and the book of seals with the mystery of faith that brings salvation. Yet the letter's mysterious origins make Gaius skeptical. He is only prepared to believe in the integrity of this vision if John really is still alive. Old Theophilus # who in reality is John himself # has been sent to the prison island of Patmos, ruled by the corrupt Roman official Corvus, as a scribe, while the other prisoners have to do hard labor in the mines. Many of them hate Theophilus/John because of the special treatment he is receiving, but above all because he is a Christian. Nevertheless he does succeed in converting some of his fellow-prisoners to Christianity, such as the young scribe Demetrius, who is planning to escape along a secret tunnel. When the shaken John tells his companions about the crucifixion of the Savior, they realize that he was there at the time and is actually John. He falls into a trance and experiences a new vision of Heaven: And one of the elders said unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. ...And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes...And he came and took the book .... And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.... Meanwhile, in Smyrna, the young Irene has taken her leave of Valerius, whom she loves with a pure heart. She does not realize that he is not a Christian at all but a spy working for the notoriously brutal Roman general Rufus, who has been ordered by Domitian to persecute Christians in Asia Minor. Valerius is a Roman soldier; born as a slave, he has his foster-father Rufus to thank for everything he has now become. He therefore has to obey when Rufus sends him to Patmos. Disguised as a prisoner, Valerius is told to find out whether John is still alive # because there are incessant rumors that he is, and they are leading to unwelcome solidarity among the Christians. Meanwhile Irene, with the help of her brother Jonicus, who visits Patmos regularly as a trader, gains access to the prison camp there. She recognizes Valerius from a distance and gets very worried about him. She embarked on all these dangers for the sake of John, however; her greatest desire is to see the last living Apostle and to tell everyone about him. John trusts her, and confides in her under the seal of secrecy. She receives his visions in written form and promises to circulate the text among the Christians. Meanwhile on Patmos Valerius tries to gain the trust of the Christian prisoners by defending the old Sostenes against the guards and suffering severe punishment as a result. Bound to a cross, he is left in the burning sunshine, but John is the only one who dares give him any water. And to Valerius's great surprise, he seems to know all about him and Rufus. In the hell of the prison camp, where violence and resentment reign, John often wonders about his mission: why has the Lord trapped him on this island, instead of sending him out into the world to spread the glad tidings? Then, surrounded by his companions, he falls into a trance ... and again he sees himself in Heaven, with the Lamb on the throne. It is being threatened by a heavily armed knight on a red horse who is bringing hatred and war to humanity. Then a black horse appears whose rider is holding a pair of scales: he is the bringer of injustice and selfishness. Meanwhile Rufus has ordered the island's governor Corvus to come and see him to tell him to show more severity, especially toward the Christians. Corvus is worried about losing his lucrative job and so he tells his guards to be even more watchful than before. As a result he notices that Irene has slipped into the camp again with Jonicus, to collect John's latest message. However, Jonicus cleverly manages to talk the guards out of searching either himself or his sister. Johns' visions become increasingly frequent and exhaust his strength. Nevertheless Demetrius is still hoping to be able to get him off the island: the tunnel is ready, and the escape is planned for that evening. But when John supports the maltreated Sostenes he incurs the wrath of the governor. He is imprisoned and the escape plans are scrapped. In his prison cell John has a new vision: the Lamb breaks the fourth seal and again a horse appears # the pale horse that brings death into the world, plagues and famines, accidents and earthquakes. Only the love of God can defeat it. That night numerous prisoners want to use the tunnel to escape, but it is discovered by the guards and the fugitives are slaughtered. For Demetrius, all hope of rescue has now vanished. But John consoles him, telling him that it is God's will that they remain here on the island. Blessed are the poor, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven, Jesus announces to him in the vision. And then he sees a huge number of people in Heaven: They called in a loud voice: Salvation cometh from our God.... The Christians of Asia Minor, all in very great danger, cling to this belief; for the Romans are murdering them all, women and men, young and old alike. Irene and Ionicus put their lives into very great danger and, with the help of a guard, manage to free John and the other Christians from the camp, the Roman spy Valerius among them. A ship is waiting at the harbor! But John is too old and weak to shake off the guards pursuing them. He takes his leave of his companions and hides in a cave together with Valerius, who is transformed by the old man's influence and becomes his helper. In the cave John goes into a prophetic trance and has his last vision: And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven... And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets. When the angels blew one after the other into the trumpets, hail, fire and locusts destroyed the earth, the sea turned to blood, darkness covered the earth and the Day of Judgment arrived. ... And I saw a new heaven and a new earth... and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain...: Meanwhile Irene, Jonicus and Demetrius are arrested by Corvus and his men, and Valerius and John are found in their cave # their lives are forfeited. But at this point Rufus arrives, and not only frees his foster son Valerius but also the other captive Christians! It turns out that the Emperor Domitian is dead, and his successor has announced an amnesty # the persecution of the Christians is over. John, his companions and the Christian communities all thank God for their salvation. Freed from his duty toward his foster father, Valerius is finally free to embrace his beloved Irene."

The cure, a treatment called the ""Return Protein"" which stays the effects of the virus in its host. With injections every 36 hours, the ""Returned"" are able to live as though they were never bit, despite the virus still coursing through their veins. When it is discovered that the protein stock is running low, chaos hits the streets. Returned who run out of the protein turn to zombies and wreak havoc, protesters turn to murderers as they try to rid the streets of the returned, and right in the middle of it all are Alex and Kate. Kate a leading doctor in the field of zombie virus' and Alex a musician with a dark secret, he is a Returned. As death and fear run rampant, Alex's secret becomes known and his dosage runs low, he and Kate must fight for a chance to live before he becomes a zombie. After a zombie outbreak, the infected people survive due to a vaccine made of the the spinal fluid of dead zombies and they are called ""Returned"". Dr. Kate works in a hospital and is responsible for the wing of Returned"". There is a rumor that the vaccine is running out and Kate secretly buys vaccines from Eve, who is the responsible for the storeroom. Kate's beloved husband, the musician Alex, was infected and only Kate and Alex's brother Jacob and his wife Amber knows. When the vaccine runs out, the government brings the infected people to quarantine centers while research a synthetic vaccine. However, Alex and Kate flee to Jacob's house in the countryside expecting that Alex survives until the synthetic vaccine becomes reality. But when Alex's wallet is stolen, Kate's last hope is to get some vaccines from the director of the hospital where she works. Will she succeed? Twenty years ago, an initial outbreak of a new virus occurred, which turned its victims into flesh and blood ravishingly zombies. One hundred million people died in that initial outbreak. Ten years ago, a natural protein was discovered at least to be a way to manage infections, as that protein, administered initially within thirty-six hours of infection with a booster every twenty-four hours keeps the virus at bay. Any missed dose of the protein leads to irreparable damage by the virus in its host, turning him/her into a zombie. There is still no known cure for the virus. Researchers are working on creating a synthetic version of the protein as the medical community is aware, but what is only rumored to be the case within the public consciousness, is that there are depleting sources of the naturally occurring protein. Those infected are treated at special hospitals and clinics to control the distribution of the protein, and so that the authorities can track those infected, who are called The Returned. Kate, a physician who treats The Returned and advocates for research funding, knows the dire situation of needing to develop a synthetic alternative of the protein. She has a personal connection as her live-in boyfriend, music teacher Alex Green, is a Returned, information which only those that need to know are aware, they only recently having told his longtime best friend, Jacob. Kate has been purchasing doses of the protein on the black market just in case. There are already those who are vehemently anti-Returned and want draconian measures to deal with them, but if the rumors do come to the public consciousness regardless of their accuracy, all out paranoia may ensue, which may place both Kate and Alex's lives at risk, especially if it is discovered that Alex is a Returned and that Kate is stockpiling the protein for Alex's use. In a post-zombie world, where the infected live normal lives, their retroviral drug is running out."

Until she meets Neil Currie, a charming and sincere bagpipe-playing, Gaelic-speaking dishwasher. But no matter what you do, you can't avoid the spectre of the pit forever. It's the 1940's. Margaret MacNeil lives in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, which is coal mining country. The coal pits have affected her life as they have most of her neighbors: both her father and older brother died in the pits and her grandfather has a respiratory illness which has rendered him speechless from his years working in the pits. The worst sound for those living in the area is a coal pit's emergency whistle, which means someone has been seriously injured or has died. As such, she refuses to date any miner, preferring to be alone. However, her fifteen year old brother, Jimmy MacNeil, is just coming to the age when all he can think about is girls, one in particular that may be a problem in their class directed society. Jimmy aspires to work in the pits to earn some money for what he sees as his future. Into Margaret's life comes bagpipe playing Scotsman Neil Currie, who used to work in the mines but purposefully got fired since the miner's life was not for him. Against her headstrong mother Catherine MacNeil's wishes, Margaret and Neil get married. Catherine doesn't see how someone like Neil can provide a life for himself, let alone Margaret. Although Neil is able to buy a run-down house that requires major repairs before he and Margaret can live there (meaning that they must live with Catherine in the meantime), he loses his dish-washing job, and against Margaret's wishes, he decides to go back into the pits. Eventually, Margaret, inspired by her life with Neil and in tribute to all the miners, decides to open a unique museum in his and their honor, especially in how the mines have affected her life. Margaret MacNiel, a girl living in a Cape Breton coal mining town, finds her life changing when she meets Neil Currie, a cheerful bagpipe-playing dishwasher. Unfortunately, neither of them are able to escape the industry around them."

2340,0077941.jpeg,,"Who was Moliere? He is known everywhere as one of the world's greatest playwrights. But who was he? Born Jean-Baptiste Poquelin in 1622, the son of a prosperous tapestry maker. His mother died when he was a boy. Growing up in the teeming streets of 17th century Paris, Jean Baptiste received a good Jesuit education and was fascinated by the street fairs and traveling carnivals that flourished in spite of the religious repression and hypocrisy of those cruel times. As a young man he joined the theatrical Bejart family to establish the Illustre-Theatre, which soon went bankrupt. The troupe reformed, found patronage, and went on the road for thirteen years, performing all over France. Poquelin developed his stagecraft adapting Commedia dell Arte plots to please brutalized peasants and cynical townspeople. He also married Madeline Bejart, the widowed daughter of the troupe's founder. Later he entered into a love affair with Mme Bejart's daughter, to the dismay of all. The troupe eventually returned to Paris and, on October 24, 1658, greatly impressed the 20-year old King Louis XIV, later to be called the Sun King. Moliere's life became bound up with the magnificent court at Versailles, and with its intrigues. He wrote, staged and acted in the plays now famous all over the world. He fought with his enemies and his friends, enjoyed success followed by failure, organized court festivities and defended himself against increasingly fanatic religious authorities. Above all, his theater was taken from life as his life was theatrical."

Various civilian prisoners were thrown with the officers in Stalag VII-Z, a camp on the site of a Neptune temple under two masters: SS Major Volkmann enjoys the unpleasant ways of brutal Nazi extremism, but the gentleman camp commandant, former dodgy Viennese art merchant Major Otto Hecht, definitely prefers the finer things in life, regardless of political 'correctness'. Therefore the camp, meant to sent Berlin archaeological treasures, actually keeps the true treasures for his private black market trade, via Hecht's sister in Switzerland. His 'guests', all fortunate to be spared by him the usual harsh treatment of escapees etc., include the brilliant archeology professor Blake, the Italian cook Bruno Rotelli, American show-people Charlie and Dottie Del Mar, and even black US POW Nat Judson. Hecht's hospitality seems poorly rewarded when they mount an elaborate plan to take over the camp, in league with the local Greek resistance leader Zeno, who is determined to prevent the arbitrary execution of villagers as reprisal. As they all seem to agree upon a common goal, the priceless art treasures in the monastery on nearby Mount Athena, Hecht is persuaded to join for a cut, but Zeno has a military agenda, as the allied invasion is approaching, and the monastery's mountain is also the cover for a secret German rocket installation...

The four cameras follow the players involved, with two or more of the four cameras sometimes filming the exact same scene from different angles and thus different perspectives. The audio on each of the four quadrants is turned up and down based on which quadrant(s) the viewer should pay most attention to at any given time. The actual plot, which takes place in Hollywood, involves the pre-production by Red Mullet Productions for the movie ""Bitch from Louisiana"". The production team is in an executive meeting to discuss several aspects of the movie, including problems with one of their own, Alex Green, who has been missing in action from much of the production and this meeting. Alex's problems stem from his substance abuse and philandering, his wife Emma who is contemplating leaving him, of which he is unaware. Lester Moore, the movie's director, is also causing the producers some concern as they believe he again is using drugs against company policy. The production team is also talking about casting the role of ""The Bitch"". One actress who wants to audition is Rose, who is having an affair with Alex as a foot in the door. Rose does not officially have an audition, although she tells her controlling lover, Lauren, that's why she is going to Red Mullet's office, while she really is meeting with Alex for a tryst. Lauren, however, believes that Rose is indeed cheating on her. Through it all, Quentin, a masseuse, is present giving free massages as a means to gain Red Mullet as a corporate client. Their goings-on come to a head during a pitch meeting by visiting European actress, Ana Pauls, who is accompanied by her agent, Bunny Drysdale, and her musician boyfriend, Joey Z. L.A., real time. From her limo, the wealthy Lauren eavesdrops on her lover Rose's tryst with movie producer Alex Green. The assignation takes place in his company's screening room between meetings. Alex's wife walks from therapy to his office, tells him she's leaving him, weeps in a bookstore restroom, and walks home with a cocaine-sniffing actress friend for what may lead to sex. Alex is drinking, wants to quit work and move to Tuscany, laughs at pretentious movie pitches, and puts off Rose when she asks for an audition. A film director sees Rose and decides she's perfect for his next picture; she takes a screen test. She's ecstatic and calls Lauren: jealousy takes over. Four frames of simultaneous action that alternately follow a smitten lesbian lover as she obsesses over her partner's dalliances and the tense goings-on of a Hollywood film production company."

Alicia Hull is the well respected and long serving head librarian at Kenport's Free Public Library, a job to which she has dedicated her life ever since the death of her husband during WWI. Some angered citizens bring to city council's attention that the library has in its inventory a book called ""The Communist Dream"", which promotes the title subject. Based on those public complaints, council requests Alicia to pull the book from the library shelves. She initially agrees, then changes her mind, believing that she was initially swayed by the earlier news from council that they were finally proceeding with Alicia's long requested pet project of an addition of a child's wing to the library, and that council by this request is censoring books and quashing freedom of expression. Alicia admits to purchasing the book, but she also states that she believes the book's tenets are preposterous. She believes that only in allowing people to read it can they come to their own conclusion that it is indeed as preposterous as she believes. Using information from unwitting assistant librarian Martha Lockridge, young and ambitious councilor Paul Duncan, Martha's fiancé, digs up information on Alicia's past activism, which includes membership in organizations that have Communist ties. Alicia does not deny those past associations, but states that she left each of those organizations when she learned of their Communist bent. Regardless, Paul uses that information to have Alicia fired since she still won't abide by council's request to pull the book. Such news labels Alicia publicly as a Communist, and she is generally ostracized by most of Kenport, even by many who had seen Alicia as a beloved community figure. Alicia, who initially wanted to fight against what is happening to her, decides she does not have the energy to do so. But as Paul uses his findings of Alicia's past to advance his own political aspirations at her expense, young Freddie Slater, who was one of the library's most ardent patrons and who has a somewhat unhappy home life if only because his father George Slater does not understand why Freddie would want to be immersed in a book when he can play sports like other ""normal"" boys instead, may make Alicia come to a different outlook based on his actions to her supposed Communism combined with the important role she has played in his life thus far. Alicia Hull lives for her work as a local librarian and the opportunity it gives to introduce the world of books to the children. When the city council put pressure on her to remove an obviously propagandist treatise ""The Communist Dream"" from the shelves she refuses on principal.

He even sublets Sonia's small apartment while she is in the hospital, he sleeping either in the homeless shelter or squatting in what he calls his ""shack"" down by the river. On the day after Sonia gets out of the hospital, she allows Bruno to take Jimmy for a walk while she stands in line for her benefits.

Some of the mail he recieves can't be delivered because it's addressed to God, and he accidentally answers (sending them money in the process). This starts the ball rolling as more of his co-workers get in on the idea of helping people by answering ""God"" mail. When letters written to God start getting results, and replies, people everywhere are amazed. The post office, however, is annoyed."

2442,0243759.jpeg,,"Space travel has become a dirty way of life dominated by derelicts, grease monkeys, thieves, and hard-boiled interplanetary traders such as Samuel Curtis, an astronaut from Earth who deals in a rare goods, living or otherwise. His mission begins with the unlikely delivery of a cat to a small outer-belt asteroid saloon where he meets his former dance partner, and renowned interplanetary fruit thief, the Blueberry Pirate. As payment for his delivery of the cat, Curtis receives a homemade cloning device already in the process of creating a creature most rare in this space quadrant... a Real Live Girl. At the suggestion of the Blueberry Pirate, Curtis takes the Real Live Girl to Jupiter where women have long been a mystery. There, he proposes a trade with the owner of Jupiter: the Real Live Girl clone for the Boy Who Actually Saw A Woman's Breast. The Boy Who Actually Saw A Woman's Breast is regarded as royalty on the all-male mining planet of Jupiter because of his unique and exotic contact with a woman. It is Curtis' intention to take The Boy to Venus and trade him for the remains of Johnny R., a man who spent his lifetime serving as a human stud for the Southern belles of Venus, a planet populated only by women. Upon returning Johnny R's body to his bereaved family on earth, Curtis will receive a handsome reward. It all seems simple enough. But while hashing out the plan with the Blueberry Pirate, Curtis is spotted by his nemesis, Professor Hess. Possessed by an enigmatic obsession with Curtis, Heiss is capable of killing without reason, unless his intended victim is someone with whom he has unresolved issues. Heiss has been pursuing Samuel Curtis throughout the solar system in order that he might forgive him, then kill him. Along the way, Heiss has executed each and every individual to come into contact with Curtis. Unaware of this danger, Curtis sets forth on his mission. After retrieving The Boy Who Actually Saw A Woman's Breast from Jupiter, Curtis is contacted by Professor Heiss, who makes his intentions known. Fearful, Curtis and The Boy look for a place to hide. They come across a primitive space station constructed by Nevada State silver miners from the late 1800s. Inside they discover a small group of miners still alive, their bodies crippled and deformed by space atrophy. Unable to return home for fear that Earth's gravity would kill them, two of the miners mated and give birth to a boy known as Bodysuit. He has been raised in a suit of hydraulics to simulate Earth's gravity with the intention of eventually sending him home. In trade for supplies and sanctuary, Curtis agrees to deliver Bodysuit to Earth. Once they land on the lush planet of Venus, the terrain dramatically changes, and Curtis is inspired by a plan. And it may just happen that in a solar system ruled by commerce and danger, sometimes good can prevail. Samuel Curtis, an interplanetary trader, sets forth through a rustic and remote solar system, unaware that his old friend Professor Hess is trying to kill him."
2443,0052561.jpeg,,"Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara), a lieutenant in the army, is arrested for the murder of a bartender, Barney Quill. He claims, in his defense, that the victim had raped and beaten up his wife Laura (Lee Remick). Although Laura supports her husband's story, the police surgeon can find no evidence that she has been raped. Manion is defended by Paul Biegler (James Stewart), a rather humble small-town lawyer. During the course of interviews, Biegler discovers that Manion is violently possessive and jealous, and also that his wife has a reputation for giving her favors to other men. Biegler realizes that the prosecution will try to make the court believe that Laura was the lover of the bartender and than Manion killed him and beat her up when he discovered them together. Manion pleads ""not guilty"" and Biegler, who knows that his case is weak, sets his assistants to try to find a witness who will save Manion. Paul Biegler is a small town lawyer who until recently had been the local prosecutor and given a lack of clients, he spends a lot of time fishing. When a murder takes place in a trailer park on the outskirts of town, he is asked to defend Lt. Frederick Manion who admits to having killed Barney Quill, a local bar owner who allegedly raped his wife. He now claims temporary insanity. The case is both prominent, with the State's Deputy Attorney General personally prosecuting the case and lurid, given the rape and the sexual nature of much of the testimony. Biegler and his friend Parnell McCarthy, now a bit the worse for wear and given to drink, must find a way to convince the jury when they little or no evidence to support their case. In Iron County, Michigan, former District Attorney Paul Biegler prefers to spend his new found time fishing and playing jazz piano. However, he, with the assistance of his alcoholic aged colleague and friend Parnell McCarthy (who is past the prime of his professional life) and his no nonsense secretary Maida Rutledge, decides to take the case of Army Lt. Frederick ""Manny"" Manion, who is charged with the murder of local bar owner Barney Quill. Biegler's decision to try the case is despite his dislike of Manion's brash and insolent attitude, and despite the fact that Manion currently has no money to pay for his services (Manion agrees to sign a promissory note once out of prison). Biegler realizes that he will have an uphill battle as although Manion doesn't remember the actual act of shooting Quill, he knows that he did indeed kill Quill. The killing was prompted by Quill's alleged rape of Manion's wife, Laura. There is no physical evidence of that act beyond Laura's black eye. The rape may also be a problem for Biegler as Laura is a seductive woman who many may consider the instigator of an extra-marital liaison. Biegler instructs the Manion's not to tell a lie to him or in court, but he still plans on getting Manion off on the charge and having Manion plead not guilty. In court, he faces the unknown in the form of Judge Weaver. In court, he also faces not only the current District Attorney, but also the bulldog of an Assistant Attorney General, Claude Dancer. Laura Manion returns home to tell her husband she's been raped. Lt. Manion kills the rapist and then claims crime of passion as a defense. At least that's his story. Paul Biegler agrees to defend him and must unravel a case in which the motivations of the murderer, his wife, and the victim are all in question. In a murder trial, the defendant says he suffered temporary insanity after the victim raped his wife. What is the truth, and will he win his case?"

Unfortunately Elle and Bud are out to stop her from getting to Bill and learning the truth about the attack on her wedding four years earlier. Getting to Bill will be an ultimately rewarding experience for Beatrix, but can she get through Bud and Elle first? The Bride woke up after a long coma.

Now, the ""Black Mamba"" has only three left on her Death List: Budd/""Sidewinder"", Bill's brother; Elle Driver/""California Mountain Snake"", the deadly one-eyed assassin; and, of course, Bill/""Snake Charmer"", her boss, teacher, and lover. However, Bill does possess one thing that keeps the ball in his court: B.B., the daughter the Bride thought she had lost in her coma. And now, at this point, the Bride knows only one thing: in the end, she will kill Bill.

The King's current contemplation of what to do stems from what he sees as Anne not fulfilling her end of the marriage in not producing a viable male heir to become the next King of England, she only bearing a daughter, Elizabeth, and a stillborn son. He sees Jane Seymour, one of Anne's ladies in waiting, as being a potential queen in her place. As much as Henry will do whatever in his power to get that desired male heir (his union to Katherine also produced only a daughter), Anne, who Henry professes to love, will do anything to ensure what she considers her and Elizabeth's rightful place within the monarchy. Henry VIII of England discards one wife, Katharine of Aragon, who has failed to produce a male heir, in favor of the young and beautiful Anne Boleyn."

The escape is partly successful, they take a hostage, who is a policeman and are pursued through to Texas... When faced with the loss of her infant son, Lou-Jean Poplin makes her husband, Clovis, escape from a minimum security prison. Threatened with capture, the couple take rookie Texas State trooper Maxwell Slide hostage, and head across the state in his patrol car. Pursued by dozens of police cars, the trio contend with their sudden elevation to folk heroes, and vigilantes out to stop them. Their only real friend may be trooper Captain Tanner, who struggles to find a peaceful end to the situation. In Texas, Lou Jean Poplin has just completed an eight month sentence for petty crimes committed. Her husband, Clovis Poplin, is in minimum security pre-release remand, where he is serving the remaining four months of a one year sentence also for petty crimes committed. Albeit by threatening means, Lou Jean convinces Clovis to break out of remand. The reason?: child welfare services have awarded permanent custody of their infant son Langston to his foster parents who live in Sugarland, Texas. Lou Jean vows to get Langston back by whatever means, and she needs Clovis' help. Early on in Clovis' escape, they take highway patrolman Matthew Slide hostage in his patrol car, he who is to drive them to Sugarland. Captain Harlin Tanner, who is leading the pursuit of the Poplins, sees that the Poplins are basically decent but misguided kids who in their current mission have committed some serious crimes, all which he takes into account when deciding on the appropriate course of action to end the pursuit while trying to protect Slide. But the case takes on a life of its own when the story hits the airwaves, with every Texan having his or her own very strong opinion on the Poplins, what they are doing and how best to help or hinder their mission. A woman attempts to reunite her family by helping her husband escape prison and together kidnapping their son. But things don't go as planned when they are forced to take a police hostage on the road."

An attractive job offer presents Dave with a major question: to pursue his career in New York City, or to remain at home with his family. Dave Spritz has a decent career as a weatherman in Chicago. He is loved and hated by people. However, his personal life is a mess, his father is dying, his ex-kids are not the brightest kids in the world, and his wife isn't fond of him.

Not a chance. What does it mean to be an adult? Chicago TV weatherman, Dave Spritz, is unhappy to be divorced, unhappy to be recognized on the street, distracted from the needs of his chubby preteen daughter and his naive teenage son, disconcerted when strangers throw things at him, and convinced he's a failure in the eyes of his father, a successful writer. In response, Dave constantly announces breathless plans to make things better - impractical, unrealistic, juvenile drivel.

The other problems in his life, an angry ex-wife, a daughter bullied at school and a son just leaving rehab don't help. And Spritz would really rather just think about sex. Through finding a hobby, connecting with his dying father and standing by his kids we see the character grow and become a hero. A Chicago weather man, separated from his wife and children, debates whether professional and personal success are mutually exclusive."

When they wake up, it turns out that not only 50 years have passed but also that they are the only living specimens of the male sex in a new, underground society composed exclusively of women. Max used to be woman-chaser so he finds himself in heaven. Albert, on the other hand, forgot all about love and sex as a serious scientist, but is willing to learn. So are the Amazons, who after a kiss turn into pliant kittens. The Council of Women is going to decide their fate, so they are trying to win more time. Two men volunteer for a cryogenics experiment, expecting to be revived in a couple of years. Instead, they are revived several years in the future, in a world with only women which is run by the League of Women's Lib. This movie has a lot of nudity. Maks and Albert agree to take part in a scientific experiment involving hibernation. The experiment is only supposed to last a couple of years; but after getting defrosted, they find themselves in a society they can't begin to understand. They gradually discover that the world has gone to hell and there are only women left on the planet, living in a humongous underground ""Vault"" (like in the game Fallout, only a lot larger ;) and ruled by the radical Women's League, which was barely even established in their day. The League has developed a thorough system of propaganda, human control and changed history, which focuses mainly on how ""males"" used to be absolutely evil (at one point when Maks and Albert are trying to defend men, they are told that ""Einstein was a woman"" and that ""one man named Cain invented murder and tested it on his sister Abel""). However, they manage to instill doubt in one woman and with her help discover that not everything - if anything - is as it seems... Two scientists are placed in hibernation and should be awaken after three years.

Orphaned, Miss Dorothy, just recently arrived, is a naive, old-fashioned girl from a seemingly privileged background who has aspirations to be a stage actress. From more modest means, Millie, in New York for three months, used to be old fashioned, but now has a new modern sensibility and look to match, complete with bobbed hair and dresses with hemlines above the knee. Included in this new modern sensibility is Millie's goal of getting a job as a stenographer, with a quick promotion to being her wealthy boss' ""Mrs."". Love is not to factor into the equation. She believes she's found the right employer in the form of chisel-jawed Trevor Graydon of the Sincere Trust Insurance Company. Millie's pursuit of Mr. Graydon is despite the fact that Mr. Graydon sees her as one of the boys, he has old fashioned sensibilities, and Millie herself has a mutual attraction to another boy named Jimmy Smith. Although she likes Jimmy, Millie feels that Jimmy, as a paper clip salesman with an overwhelming happy-go-lucky attitude, is not driven enough to be husband material. That doesn't stop Jimmy's pursuit of Millie. In her association with Jimmy, Millie meets flamboyant wealthy Renaissance woman Muzzy Van Hossmere. Jimmy's father once worked as Muzzy's gardener. Originally from humble means much like Millie, Muzzy tries to convince Millie that true love will lead to happiness, as that is what happened when she met the now deceased Mr. Van Hossmere who she had no idea was rich.

Millie Dillmount, a fearless young lady fresh from Salina, Kansas, determined to experience Life, sets out to see the world in the rip-roaring Twenties.

Prominently displayed outside the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, renowned and reclusive land artist Michael Heizer's ""Levitated Mass"" gained worldwide recognition during its installation in 2012. Over the course of 10 nights, a 340-ton solid granite boulder crawled through Southern California neighborhoods on a 294-foot-long, 206-wheeled trailer, drawing hundreds of camera crews and cell phone shooters alike to document its journey. Tens of thousands of people came out to watch the megalith travel through their communities to its final resting place over a 456-foot-long negative space formed by a concrete slot. ""Levitated Mass"" is one of the only pieces of art in recent history to inspire such a reaction in pop culture, bringing together the art community, public officials, and the general population to debate the merits and pitfalls of a giant stone suspended above their heads.

Running through the whole film is a portrayal of the Johns' friendship and ultimately, their view of the world, which we see in interviews with the Giants themselves, their colleagues, and their fans.

Wasting no time, Adam starts an affair with her bookish sister, who knows about the first relationship. Their (none-too-happily) married third sister knows about both these liaisons but is still attracted to Adam. The lad is certainly playing the field, but in their own ways the girls seem to be getting just as much out of the deal as him. In Dublin, Ireland, the adult Owens sisters are in different stages of and have different outlooks on romance. The eldest, Alice Rooney, is in a stable if somewhat boring marriage to Martin Rooney, with a baby daughter Jean adding to that stable, traditional family life. Middle sister Laura Owens, an academic, believes it better to have no relationship than to be in one without that fairy-tale passion, much like the romances in literature which she studies. Youngest sister Lucy Owens, an aspiring singer and a waitress at a local bar, goes in and out of relationships easily, she recently just having broken it off with her latest boyfriend Simon, an aspiring stand-up comic, and never yet having had that passionate relationship to which Laura so aspires. Into their collective lives comes Adam, a photographer and gallery owner, who becomes ensconced within their family. Unlike Martin who she doesn't much like, Mrs. Owens would love to see Adam as part of the family. Adam does touch on something primal and different in each of the sisters, one who he does openly embark on in a relationship, that sister unaware of what is happening between him and her sisters. Certain situations involving Adam are presented from the different perspective of each of the sisters. If Adam does end up as part of the family and with which sister and/or if he does have a longer term effect on each of their romantic lives is also affected by David Owens, the sisters' younger brother, who is in a stalled situation sexually with his current girlfriend Karen, and who sees in Adam the ""bro"" he has never had... and perhaps more. A waitress falls for a handsome customer who seduces her, her two sisters, her brother, and her brother's girlfriend."

2591,0064482.jpeg,,"Produced at the height of the Vietnam War, Emile de Antonio's Oscar-nominated 1968 documentary chronicles the war's historical roots. With palpable outrage, De Antonio (Point of Order, Underground) assembles period interviews with journalists, politicians, and key military personnel and international newsreel and archival footage to create a scathing chronicle of America's escalating involvement in this divisive conflict. The savage and horrific images speak for themselves in perhaps the most controversial film of de Antonio's career, and the film he cites as his personal favorite. This Oscar-nominated documentary looks at those who were opposed to American involvement in the war in Vietnam. Released in 1968 as public opposition to U.S. involvement was still rising, several prominent Americans are interviewed. The history of the Vietnam conflict is explained and provides a stark contrast of the government view of the time that U.S. involvement in this war was part of an overall fight against the spread of communism. The horrors of war are presented giving a stark representation of what the war was like, particularly for the Vietnamese who had to live through it every day,"

The beauty of Lucy attracts the attention of the corrupt Judge Turpin, who falsely accuses the barber of a crime that he did not commit and abuses Lucy later after gaining custody of her. After fifteen years in exile, Benjamin returns to London under the new identity of Sweeney Todd, seeking revenge against Turpin. He meets the widow Mrs. Lovett who is the owner of a meat pie shop who tells him that Lucy swallowed arsenic many years ago, and Turpin assigned himself tutor of Johanna. He opens a barber shop above her store, initiating a crime rampage against those who made him suffer and lose his beloved family. Benjamin Barker, arguably the most accomplished barber in all Victorian London, is married to the pretty Lucy, the two who have an infant daughter, Johanna. Lusting after Lucy, a sadistic judge named Turpin wrongfully has Barker sent to prison in Australia so that he can have Lucy to himself. Fifteen years later, Barker, who has rechristened himself Sweeney Todd, returns to London to seek revenge by killing Turpin and his accomplice Beadle Bamford, using the instruments of his trade to slit their throats. Below Todd's old barber shop is now a meat pie shop run by Mrs. Lovett, who admits to making the worst meat pies in London. She tells Todd that Lucy poisoned herself after being raped by Turpin, and that Johanna, now a young woman, is Turpin's ward. Johanna and a young honorable sailor named Anthony Hope, who Todd met sailing into London, have fallen in love with each other from afar. Much like his feelings for Lucy, Turpin lusts after Johanna and wants to marry her, and thus he will do whatever he needs to to get Anthony out of the way. Back at the barber shop, Todd changes his plans for revenge solely on Turpin and Beadle out of circumstance, which includes an encounter with a rival barber named Adolfo Pirelli and a close encounter with Turpin himself. Including Turpin and Beadle, Todd's revenge is now directed at all mankind that has wronged him. Todd is helped in his new endeavor by Mrs. Lovett, who has an interesting role in their collective scheme. Todd may reconsider his new collaboration with Mrs. Lovett if he were to learn her true motivations. After hard years in exile for a crime he didn't commit, Benjamin Barker, now Sweeney Todd, returns to London to find his wife dead and his daughter in the hands of the evil Judge Turpin. In his anger, Sweeney goes on a murderous rampage on all London. With the help of Mrs. Lovett, he opens a barber shop in which he lures his victims with a charming smile before casually ending their lives with a flick of his razor across their necks. But not one man nor ten thousand men killed can satisfy Sweeney's lust for vengeance on those who've caused his years of pain. Returning back to London after his wife and daughter were been stolen by Judge Turpin, Benjamin Barker adopts the name Sweeney Todd and relocates his barber business to the top of Mrs. Lovett's pie shop. Todd wants his revenge on the man who has now adopted his daughter and works with Mrs. Lovett on an evil plan. Todd will slice the throats of the unsuspecting public while giving them a shave. These bodies are then turned into Mrs. Lovett's new meat pies. With this plan being successful, all Todd needs to do now is try to convince the Judge to sit in his chair.
